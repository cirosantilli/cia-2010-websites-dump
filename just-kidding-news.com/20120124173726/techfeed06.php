On Monday, Intel shelled out $125 million to buy Infiniband from Qlogic, a little-known maker of data center networking switches and cards. It seems like an odd move. Infiniband is a networking fabric technology, similar to Ethernet, but not nearly as widely used. So why is Intel paying millions for technology that lost out in the business world? Because supercomputing systems are now turning into big business.

When it launched last November, Amazon's Kindle Fire was touted as the first tablet to seriously challenge Apple's iPad. Since then, the iPad and Kindle Fire have seemingly been embroiled in a zero-sum war of tablet market dominance. But perhaps that's not exactly what's going on.

The Department of Homeland Security wants to take a cue from the military's experience with wartime surveillance. It's looking for a camera that can spy on four square miles -- entire neighborhoods -- at once, just like the military has.
