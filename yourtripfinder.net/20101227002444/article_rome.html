Modern and old, past and present go side by side, all the time. 
Whether you are in Rome for 3 days, 3 weeks or 3 months, be prepared to step into the world’s biggest open air museum. You can decide to follow the typical tourist paths or you can be luck or brave enough to go off the usual tracks. </p>
<p>One way or the other, Rome will seduce you and it will hardly leave you indifferent. It will surprise you that it still has plenty to offer with beauty that has just been blurred by time passing by. 
</p>
<p>Rome is one of world's most photogenic cities - not surprising when you remember what's here - The Vatican, the Trevi Fountain, St Peter's Square, Spanish Steps, Colosseum...</p>
<p>Whether you spend your time sightseeing, or lazing in cafés watching the world go by, it will be your turn to feature in your very own Roman Holiday. </p>
<p>
Rome is a romantic place for honey-moon, favorite holiday destination, and city of fashion.</p>
