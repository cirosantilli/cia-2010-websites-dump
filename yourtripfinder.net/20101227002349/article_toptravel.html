<p><a href="http://www.expedia.com" target="_blank">Expedia</a><br>
The big grand-daddy of online travel aggregators is Expedia. With services for flights, hotels and car rentals this one-stop shop should be on your list of sites to visit when booking tickets for your Summer travel.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com" target="_blank">Trip Advisor </a><br>
Nipping at the heels of Expedia we have Trip Advisor. Historically Trip Advisor has been a site focused on travel reviews. But with the addition of flight and hotel booking, and more, Trip Advisor has grown into a serious Expedia competitor.

<p><a href="http://www.travelocity.com" target="_blank">Travelocity</a><br>
You may know travelocity from its garden gnome mascot, seen on many television commercials. Currently at number 3 on the list of top online travel sites with a rank of 682, Travelocity is not faring as well in the downturn with traffic to the site showing a slight downturn.

<p><a href="http://www.orbitz.com" target="_blank">Orbitz</a><br>
Another site that has done quite a bit on online advertising is Orbitz, whose commercials might be confused with Orbit gum, both of which use 50's stylizations and a blue color scheme. Orbitz is still one of the most popular online travel sites, but has seen some decline over the past two years. Like Expedia and Travelocity, Orbitz is a full-featured online travel aggregator.
