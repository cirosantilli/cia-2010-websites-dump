By John Strege DUBLIN, Ohio -- The team format would seem to be anathema to one whose life has been devoted to the relentless pursuit of individual glory. For Tiger Woods, to twist a cliche, there is no team in I. Yet Woods was, if not giddy, at least cheery here on Tuesday, two days before the start of the Presidents Cup, for which the team apparently has played a role. "It's just the guys," he said. "What goes on in the team room is a lot of fun. The ribbing, there's a lot of needling going on and I think that's what people probably don't really understand, how close these teams are." He seems to get a particular charge out of Jason Dufner, who on the course gives off a languid vibe apparently at odds with his demeanor off the course. "He's totally different than what anyone thinks," U.S. captain Fred Couples said. "He's got a huge sense of humor." Tiger seems genuinely amused by Dufner, though he won't say why, other than that he's surprisingly chatty in the team room and that "you wouldn't expect the things that come out of his mouth. "Kuch [Matt Kuchar] is the same way," Woods said. "They are pretty funny guys and you expect the unexpected with those two." Funny as in ha-ha, he was asked, or funny as in peculiar? "Both," he said. "And it could be in the same sentence." Woods no doubt will find his game face between now and Thursday; it's still golf and competition. But there's a chance he'll find himself paired with Dufner at some point, and for Woods, playing at Muirfield Village is akin to a home game; he's won the Memorial Tournament five times there. He also is rested following a week at home between the end of the Tour Championship and arriving here. He spent the time chasing "a four- and six-year-old," he said of his kids, Sam and Charlie. "I didn't touch a club until Friday and Friday was just putting. Just shut it down. Did a lot of training. Got my body feeling good. Then started to practice and get ready and then by the weekend I was full-go."

By John Strege DUBLIN, Ohio -- A mystery in the run-up to Thursday's start of the Presidents Cup at Muirfield Village Golf Club here is really no mystery at all, to hear the respective captains tell it. Who will partner with whom? "If you go out and look at our [practice round] pairings you can probably figure it out," Couples said. "It's not going to be too difficult." Related: 13 reasons to be excited about the Presidents Cup It isn't quite that easy. Tiger Woods, for instance, played with both Jason Dufner and Matt Kuchar in a practice round on Tuesday. There, too, is the fact that "everyone wants to play with Tiger," Couples said. Everyone? "Phil [Mickelson] probably won't." Woods and Mickelson, arch rivals, partnered together in two matches at the 2004 Ryder Cup and lost both. Couples said that Steve Stricker "will probably play with him a little bit." The last time the Presidents Cup was in the U.S., in 2009, they were 4-0 playing together. "I have consistency in Steve Stricker, Phil Mickelson and Tiger and pretty much whatever they say is going to happen," Couples said. "They have been on 50 teams, probably, amongst the three of them." Mickelson is likely to pair with Keegan Bradley. The duo went 3-0 playing together in the Ryder Cup last year. For his part, International captain Nick Price also seems willing to let his players decide for themselves, at least to some degree. "I got a lot of good feedback from the guys on that," he said. "They were pretty sure about who they wanted to play with, which made my job a lot easier." Related: Rating Woods' on-course 'bromances' through the years Price has six South Africans on his team, and presumably there are combinations of players already comfortable playing with one another. Price, meanwhile, paired South African Ernie Els with countryman Brendan de Jonge in the practice round on Tuesday. "I think that Ernie's a wonderful calming influence on Brendan," Price said. "He [de Jonge] and Marc [Leishman], maybe [being captain's] picks, might be a little nervous and apprehensive, so my thinking was putting them with some of the more experienced guys." The pairings for Thursday's foursomes will be announced on Wednesday.

By Alex Myers Welcome to another edition of The Grind, where we hope this government shutdown doesn't affect this week's Presidents Cup. Speaking of which, if the federal government is at a standstill, does that mean U.S. captain Fred Couples is currently our nation's highest-ranking official?Fortunately, we don't need two houses of Congress to approve our work, so on we go . . . Here comes the Phil and Keegan ShowWE'RE BUYING Web.com Tour Finals: The Web.com Tour's finale had a bit of everything on Sunday, including one of the most improbable clutch putts ever made. Lee Williams needed to make a 55-footer over a ridge on the final hole to earn a PGA Tour card for next season and he converted. There were plenty other players, veterans of both the Web.com and PGA Tours, securing a top job for next year, including potential future stars like John Peterson (who won the four-event money title) and Chesson Hadley (who won the Web.com's Tour Championship). Wait, the dude's name is Chesson? OK, we're not buying that. Peter Uihlein: No, he didn't win the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship, losing in a playoff to David Howell, but the 24-year-old did make waves on Friday when he nearly shot the first-ever 59 on the European Tour at Kingsbarns. Uihlein, the 2010 U.S. Amateur champ who has already won in Europe this year, showed once again that he could challenge Jordan Spieth as America's next big star. Related: The best -- and worst -- shots of the PGA Tour season PGA Tour players: It was good to see these guys put aside any possible personal agendas and voted for the right player, Tiger Woods, for PGA Tour Player of the Year. Something tells us there could be a different result when the golf writers vote for their player of the year. Graeme McDowell: One of golf's most likeable characters got married over the weekend to Kristin Stape (above) in the Bahamas. Enough said. WE'RE SELLING Rory McIlroy: Speaking of G-Mac's wedding, his buddy (look at that pic of the happy trio again. You know you were anyway) and fellow countryman was noticeably absent. Instead, it was reported McIlroy went out the same night with soccer star Wayne Rooney while in the UK for a photo shoot. Odd. This also happens to be the first piece of news about McIlroy since the formation of his own management team, Rory McIlroy Inc. Good start! European stars: Neither McIlroy or McDowell or just about any big-name European Tour player will be at this week's Seve Trophy event in France. With McDowell presumably on his honeymoon with Kristin Stape, he gets a pass. Paul Lawrie was very critical of his 2012 Ryder Cup teammates, who just a year ago made a big deal about honoring the late Ballesteros. Good for Lawrie for speaking his mind. Related: PGA Tour courses in 2013 by the numbers Andres Gonzalez: This is more a sympathy 'sell' for one of golf's best funnymen, although he did come up short on a 12-footer that he had to make on the final hole of the Web.com Tour Championship. As a result, Gonzalez came up just short of earning a PGA Tour card for next season, getting knocked out by Lee Williams' improbable, long-range dagger. Gonzalez then did a live TV interview that was painful to watch. But hey, isn't this exactly the type of stuff that all those Q School supporters wanted to see? ON TAP Taking center stage this week is the Presidents Cup, aka the one sporting event where the over-used "it's us against the world(!)" rally cry actually applies.

By Dave Shedloski Jack Nicklaus has played enough different brands of golf balls, tested them enough and talked about them enough to determine he could build his own ball. And he's decided to do just that. Golf World has learned that Nicklaus, winner of a record 18 professional major championships, is introducing a line of golf balls starting in November with the objective of helping golfers select a ball that best matches their skill level. Three balls will be available: Nicklaus Black, Nicklaus Blue and Nicklaus White, corresponding to the tee markers from which golfers regularly play. The Nicklaus Black is designed for the single-digit handicap golfer who might typically play from the back tees. The Nicklaus Blue is for players who use middle teeing areas, while the Nicklaus White is for higher handicap players, either men or women, who play from forward tees. Related: Golf balls reviewed in Golf Digest's Hot List In the past, Nicklaus has lent his name to signature brands of golf balls, but the new Nicklaus line is proprietary, manufactured to his specifications after three years of testing. Nicklaus said Bridgestone is manufacturing the balls and counseled on its design. A percentage of sales will be donated to the Nicklaus Children's Health Care Foundation, which Nicklaus and his wife, Barbara, established in 2004 to support pediatric programs nationwide. "We all know that the game of golf can be challenging enough, so we are trying to simplify the decision-making process of selecting the right golf ball and at the same time provide consumers the highest-quality golf balls and at a price that encourages charitable support," Nicklaus, 73, and winner of 73 PGA Tour titles, said in a statement. "By buying these balls, players will get the added benefit of supporting these wonderful charities that help children in need as well as the families that dearly love them." The balls, which go into production within the next few weeks, will be sold online at www.nicklaus.com and through golf shops at more than 200 courses in the Nicklaus Design portfolio. The Nicklaus Black will have a suggested retail price around $50 per dozen in pro shops, while the Nicklaus Blue and Nicklaus White models will be priced in the mid-$40s. Online shoppers can purchase the balls for $32 and $26, respectively, with the option of adding a donation earmarked for the Nicklaus Children's Health Care Foundation. "For more than three years, we have contemplated entering the golf ball business, so over that time, I have been researching and testing golf balls," said Nicklaus, who has been a proponent for growing the game through the First Tee, Tee It Forward and other initiatives. "There are a lot of very good balls on the market, but I was not able to find a ball that fully met my expectations and hopes -- not just for me or other professionals, but more importantly, for the everyday golfer. So I simply decided not to enter the business until I found that ball. Well, I found that ball. Actually, I found three. "These golf balls are designed for every level of play, from the everyday or recreational golfer -- be it men, women, children, or seniors -- to the tour professional. No matter the age or ability, there is a golf ball to fit your game. Our strategy is based on a simple principle: skill level is an extremely important factor when selecting the right golf ball. From the tees you play, we know your swing speed; this is paramount when choosing a golf ball. But no matter the percentage of players who know their swing speed, 100 percent of them know the tees they play." The introduction of a Nicklaus-designed ball is the latest venture with Nicklaus Companies co-chairman Howard Milstein, New York Private Bank &amp; Trust Chairman and CEO, with whom Nicklaus partnered in 2007. "The beauty of these balls," Milstein said, "is they solve the golfers' dilemma of which ball to play -- all you need to know is the tee you play from -- and no matter what your skill level, you know we've designed the highest quality golf ball best suited to your game." Related: How to find the right ball for you For more than three decades Nicklaus has been outspoken about calling for golf's governing bodies to rein in the distance that modern golf balls travel. The extra distance makes golf more expensive through additional land, water usage and maintenance costs. He remains consistent on the subject. "The game of golf is a lot bigger than any individual or any individual piece of it," Nicklaus said. "My position hasn't changed in relation to the golf ball. What's important is what's best for the game of golf. "This is another way for me to contribute to the game of golf in a positive way and to help grow the game," the Golden Bear added. "It's about helping the average golfer enjoy the game more. The average golfer has to make up his mind whether he wants to hit it as far as he can or get the results that he wants around the greens. He really can't have both with today's balls. What we are offering them is a chance to play the best ball they can get that will give them the most distance, the most playability, and the most control for their swing speed."

By Alex Myers The March 2011 cover of Golf Digest had an image of Graeme McDowell about to hit a golf ball off a tee in Rory McIlroy's mouth and had the headline "How to Play Fearless Golf." Perhaps John Daly is taking our magazine's advice a bit too literally. Related: Golf's greatest power hitters An Instagram video has surfaced in which Daly pulled off the feat in a Nashville parking lot. A stranger apparently volunteered to lay down and be the pro despite the fact that it was dark out and Daly was wearing sandals. Daly appears to make good contact (with the ball) and thankfully, nobody was hurt. As long as the ball didn't happen hit an innocent bystander.

By Luke Kerr-DineenThere was a time, in 2003, high off a breathtaking duel between Ernie Els and Tiger Woods, when people openly wondered if the Presidents Cup was a better competition than the Ryder Cup.&nbsp;A European golfer hadn't won a major championship in more than four years (and wouldn't for another four), while the International team featured the PGA Tour's leading money winner, Vijay Singh, reigning Masters champion Mike Weir -- who probably ought to have won that year's PGA Tour Player of the Year -- and both Els and Retief Goosen, the former just a year removed from his third major victory, the latter playing the year preceding his second U.S. Open victory.&nbsp;But 10 years on, the International team has regressed substantially, and has dragged with it the reputation of the Presidents Cup.Consider those at the top of the 2013 International team's roster. There's no denying Adam Scott is a top player and looks to be for the foreseeable future, but Jason Day, the team's next highest-ranked player, for all the potential he may show for tomorrow, today has just one PGA Tour victory to his name. Had Day been American, he would likely scrape into the No. 10 spot.&nbsp;Els remains on the team, but his time among golf's elite is fading fast, while his countrymen Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel have each yet to win on the PGA Tour since their major victories in 2010 and 2011, respectively, despite more than 90 starts between them.Related: Why 'The Other' Cup Matters&nbsp;The 2003 team was stronger even towards the bottom of the order. It boasted the likes of Robert Allenby, Stuart Appleby, K.J. Choi, Nick Price -- all multiple PGA Tour winners with proven track records in majors. In 2013, Angel Cabrera aside, the Hideki Matsuyama/Branden Grace/Graeme DeLaet/Richard Sterne combination may be full of potential, but as any college golf coach will explain, banking on potential is a dangerous game.&nbsp;And while 2003 may have been an especially strong team, it was far from an anomaly. The 2007 team boasted six major winners, one more than the U.S. team, with another, Trevor Immelman, just months away from joining that circle. Two years later it claimed seven, again one more than the U.S. This year, it has five to the U.S.'s six.&nbsp;It's hard to understand why the International team is getting worse. Perhaps it's the flowering of Europe's young talent. Perhaps it's just the natural order of things. But whatever the cause, spectators are left hoping their team of DeLaets and Sternes and Graces will propel them to victory for the first time since 1998. That very idea undercuts the party line of Presidents Cup apologists: "give it time, the competition is developing."&nbsp;The truth is the competition isn't developing. We've gone from a point where the International team couldn't care less about the lack of Europeans on their team to today, where (if they were allowed) Europeans would fill seven of its roster spots, and that's before any captain's picks.&nbsp;Now there's a tournament worth watching.Related: Who would make your combined Presidents-Ryder Cup squad?Follow @lukekerrdineen&nbsp;

By Tim Rosaforte From the September 30 edition of Golf World Monday: Scott Langley returned to Pebble Beach last week to offer testimony on what The First Tee can do for a life -- and a career. Langley was a 2012 PGA Tour rookie who won the pro-junior event at the Champions Tour's Nature Valley First Tee Open in 2006. He also tied for low amateur honors in the 2010 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, and to show how far he has come in the past seven years, Langley was invited to play with PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem and Jay Haas at Cypress Point last Thursday, the day he was also scheduled to address The First Tee and Champions Tour participants at a Legends and Leaders dinner. Related: Golf Digest's golfers who give back Coming to the 18th hole, Langley was told by Sam Reeves, their host, that if he holed his second shot, it would mean tying the course record 63 held by, among others, Ben Hogan. From 125 yards out, Langley hit the flagstick with his shot and made a 2Â¿-footer for the 64. That night Langley looked out over the audience at The Beach Club, and said to the young men and women sitting nervously in their chairs, "I know how you feel. Seven years ago, I was sitting where you are." Langley made an impression on the audience not only for the way his career panned out, but also for the way he embodies The First Tee's core values. He grew up in the suburbs of St. Louis, a blue-collar golfer who hit scarred range balls off mats until a First Tee chapter was established. "I wouldn't say I came from a poor background," Langley said. "But I didn't have a silver spoon in my mouth. I didn't have a chip on my shoulder, but I knew I had to work hard at everything I was going to get." Among the 81 First Tee participants listening intently to Langley was Brittany Ferrante, a 5-foot-2, 100-pound, 16-year-old high school senior who plays No. 1 on the Walt Whitman High boys' team in Huntington Station on New York's Long Island. Brittany didn't have a stable life at home the way Langley did. Her parents had issues. As part of her essay, she wrote about her mother attempting suicide. Constantly in between jobs as a civil engineer, her father went on the Internet and found a First Tee chapter near their home at Eisenhower Park. "I have no idea where we would be [without the First Tee], but we wouldn't be in a good spot," Ferrante said, acknowledging her brother, Dominick, who made the trip as her caddie. Related: Photos of Pebble Beach She played alongside Rocco Mediate and although she did not make the cut, it was still the experience of a young lifetime. Golf Channel featured Brittany, even using her silhouette against the beach in the closing credits Friday. Billy Ray Brown made the comment on air, "Don't be fooled. She hits it miles." Like Langley, Ferrante has aspirations of playing college golf, then pro golf. Plan B is to be an elementary school teacher or open a golf academy. She heads back to New York this morning with dreams of returning to Pebble Beach, maybe as head of a First Tee chapter. "It wasn't what I expected," she said. "It was more."
