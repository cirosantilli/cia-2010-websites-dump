The Golf Blog says: Henrik Stenson went wire-to-wire to win the Tour Championship by 3 strokes (-13). The win put Stenson on top of the FedEx Cup, toppling Tiger Woods from the No. 1 spot. The Swede is the first European to win the FedEx Cup and its $10 million paycheck. Great job, Henrik! Next big question: Who should win the Player of the Year? Tiger, with 5 wins, but no majors? Adam Scott? That is one happy Swede! @henrikstenson pic.twitter.com/OPXCqG6py2 &mdash; Todd Lewis (@ToddLewisGC) September 22, 2013

Scott wins Barclays with bogey-free round http://t.co/NQJNiNI01x &mdash; Scotty Dog Golf Ltd (@scottydoggolf) August 25, 2013 The Golf Blog says: Adam Scott finished with a 66 to go -11 for the tourney and then waited as the other golfers couldn&#8217;t match his score. Tiger Woods almost pulled off a miracle birdie-birdie-birdie finish, despite back spasms that derailed his game midround. The final putt fell a few inches short. The 54 hole leader Gary Woodland had two decent looks for birdie on the last two holes, but he couldn&#8217;t make a putt all day. Phil Mickelson, who shot a 65, came very close to matching -11, but his bomb on 17 lipped out and he bogeyed 18. Phil correctly predicted, however, that the winning score would be -11.

The Golf Blog says: Scott Brown got a really lucky bounce off the rocks near the bridge in the water hazard on No. 16 at the Barclays Tournament. The ball bounced onto the green for a near tap in eagle. One of the funkiest and luckiest eagles in recent memory. Click here for the video

Kevin Stadler leads at -7, while Camillo Villegas (who led much of the day and has abandoned his Spiderman routine), Henrik Stenson, and Ryan Palmer are one back. Tiger Woods is at -4, tied with a bunch of guys. Click here for the Leaderboard
