By Derek Evers Sergio Garcia reacts after making an eagle putt on 18. Photo: Jim Rogash Is Sergio making a major FedEx move? Sergio Garcia normally skips the second week of the FedEx playoffs, but sitting in 55th place after the Barclays, there was no guarantee he would be around to play the BMW if he did so this year. Now, after a second-round 64 -- including an eagle on the closing hole -- not only does Garcia look to be a lock to finish among the top 70 in the standings after the Deutsche Bank Championship, he could suddenly be thrust into the title conversation. With a win in Boston, Garcia would move up 52 spots to third place; trailing only Tiger Woods and Adam Scott. Incidentally, Garcia was having a stellar-season before some less-than-stellar comments about Tiger Woods derailed him. Imagine the made-for-TV drama that would ensue with a Tiger / Sergio face-off in the Tour Championship.

While the PGA Tour will finish up on Labor Day this week, the senior circuit is on a normal weekend schedule, and one man has been leading the way since the first round of the Shaw Charity Classic. After eagling two of the final four holes on Friday, Rocco Mediate took a one-stroke lead into the weekend. A lead he would extend to two strokes with a Saturday 64. Now the 50-year-old Champions Tour rookie is in line for his second win of 2013 -- one that would catapult him into the top-10 money winners on tour. Cantlay punching his ticket to the PGA Tour?One week after former UCLA star Patrick Cantlay missed his chance to wrap up a PGA Tour card at the Cox Classic in Omaha, he's looking like a man who's not going to make the same mistake twice. Sitting in the top 25 on the Web.com Tour money list heading into last week's event, he fell out of a guaranteed card to 29th place and now must fight Nos. 26-75, as well as Nos. 126-200 on the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup standings, for the last 25 cards in the four-event Web.com Tour Finals series. Following a two-eagle, six-birdie performance to take a three-stroke lead heading into the final round of the Hotel Fitness Championship, the 21-year-old is solidifying his chances of being one of those deserving 25.

Then he doesn't retire.Give Anaheim Ducks wing Teemu Selanne, aka the Finnish Flash, credit for this creative announcement that he would be returning for a 21st NHL season. The basic storyline: golf is too hard. I'd rather play hockey. By the way, Selanne, the 14th-highest scorer in NHL history, is not the hapless hacker portrayed in the video. He carries a 5.2 index out of Coto De Caza Golf &amp; Racquet Club in Orange County, Calif.Follow @SamWeinman

By Ron Sirak NORTON, Mass. -- The clubface no sooner made contact with the golf ball than Phil Mickelson uttered a rather mournful, "Oh no, sit!" No dice. Cart path. Wicked bounce. Hazard. But this is Phil the Thrill we are talking about. Of course he would find his ball and of course he would shun easy answers and decide to play out of the hazard. What resulted was an all-world bogey -- he actually had about a 30-foot run at par -- to finish off an eight-under-par 63 in the first round the Deutsche Bank Championship. Tiger Woods watches Phil Mickelson tees off at the tenth hole during the first round of the Deutsche Bank Championship. Photo: Stan Badz There is something about the way Mickelson lumbers around the golf course that makes you want to say, "Hey, ya big galoot, how the heck ya doin'?" That answer right now would seem to be, "Just fine, thank you." Lefty, who flew home from New Jersey to California on Sunday night to be there for his daughter Amanda's first day of high school then flew back to Massachusetts on Wednesday night, was in full Phil mode Friday at TPC Boston. Playing with Tiger Woods and Adam Scott, Mickelson played the back nine first and started birdie-birdie, made a pair of ho-hum pars then closed with five birdies in a row for a tasty 28 going out. He bogeyed this tenth hole -- No. 1 -- from the greenside bunker, missing a seven-footer, knocked his second shot to 18 inches on the par-5 second hole for eagle to get to eight under par and the 59 watch was on -- he needed 12 under for that magic number. But five pars in a row ended that dream, a birdie on No. 8 got him to nine under and the bogey at the last returned him to eight and the 63, which was good enough for the first-round lead. "I didn't hit shots exceedingly close, other than that eagle on 2," Mickelson said. "But what I did is make a lot of 12- to 20-foot putts, the ones that you need to make to get a really hot round." And "really hot" seems to be the way to describe Mickelson right now. He closed The Barclays last week with a six-under par 65, after a 70 in Saturday's third round, to finish T-6. Related: Woods, Mickelson and Player of the Year In his last two rounds -- Sunday at Barclays and Friday here -- Mickelson has made 15 birdies and an eagle. "I felt like Saturday is when it started to click," Lefty said. "I had a good feeling that I as going to have a low round on Sunday. And I felt very confident that I was going to have a good week here." That confidence probably spiked a little bit when he saw his pairing for the first two rounds here. Quite frankly, and even Mickelson will admit this, after more than 20 years on tour he struggles at times with focus and concentration. But there are two things that get Phil's full attention: Winning major championships, as he did last month at the British Open, capturing the claret jug at Muirfield, and beating Tiger Woods. Asked after his 63 dusted the 68 put up by Tiger if playing with Woods still brings out the best in him, Phil said: "After today it's hard to think any differently." Using his Phrankenwood -- a smallish, old-timey looking wood with extra loft -- as his driver, Mickelson hit 11 of 14 fairways and converted that into 14 of 18 greens, then needed only 25 putts. The only really bad swing was that one on No. 9, his last hole, which was a pull-hook into the right hazard. "You know, I just mentally went blank for a swing," was Mickelson's typically honest explanation of the wayward drive on the last hole. "It happens. And I just try to forget it. It only cost me one shot." Related: The PGA Player of the Year is far from decided This is a pretty good time for Mickelson to kick his game into high gear. There are a few things he has never accomplished in his remarkable career that are within reach. Phil has never led the PGA Tour money list. He has never been PGA Tour Player of the Year. Nor has he won the FedEx Cup or been No. 1 in the World Ranking. All but the last are possible with three more big events to play -- two FedEx Cup playoff events and the season-finale Tour Championship. "It's something I'd like to capture," Mickelson said about the FedEx Cup. "And I just want to play well these next three weeks because I feel like if I can add a win or two I have a realistic chance at Player of the Year." The good news for Mickelson is that he has the same pairing in Saturday's second round at 1:10 p.m. as he did in the first -- Scott and Woods, the two guys he trails in the FedEx Cup standings. And while Tiger pushes Phil into a higher gear, Woods was a bit cranky after his opening-round 68 -- or at least abrupt. "The back is fine, all good," he replied when asked about the injury for which he says he's been treated "two or three times a day" since he tweaked it over the weekend at the Barclays. "It was decent today," he said. "I didn't hit it as well as I'd like to." The best indication that Woods' back is better? Asked if he was going to practice after his round, Tiger replied: "Going right now." Earlier he had said it was "day to day" as to whether the back issues would interfere with his practice routine. "Not a lot going on for me," Tiger said about his scoring opportunities, "but Phil was getting everything." Now, I'm not exactly sure what that means, but I am betting that when Mickelson reads those words he will find a slight in there somewhere and use it for a bit of motivation. On Friday, Mickelson shot 63 while paired with his human 5-Hour Energy Drink. Maybe playing with Tiger again on Saturday will motivate him enough to take control of this tournament and bring the FedEx Cup in sight. Hey, it ain't a major, but Lefty is playing with Woods. And that seems to be motivation enough.

By Alex Myers We all know who won golf's major championships in 2013, but there's still a lot to be learned from sifting through the stats from the game's four marquee events. How much did distance matter? Did anyone gain an edge from accuracy off the tee? Was greens hit in regulation or how players fared when they missed greens a better indicator of success? Related: Try GolfDigest.com's majors interactive tool Thanks to our new interactive tool, you can sort through the data yourself to get a better understanding of why the leader boards turned out the way they did. For instance, everyone focused on Jason Dufner's performance from tee to green at the PGA Championship, but did you know a big part of why he took home the Wanamaker Trophy was because he led the field at Oak Hill in scrambling? A cold putter was a big reason why Woods didn't win a major in 2013.Did you know that only 13 players made the cut in all four majors? Did you know that Martin Kaymer was one of those players? How did Jason Day tie for the lowest score in relation to par and not collect a first major trophy? And what about Tiger Woods? The World No. 1 has five tour wins in 2013, yet his drought in majors grew to five years. The 14-time major champion didn't excel in any of the statistical categories we tracked. And while a wayward driver got most of the attention from his critics, it was the shortest club in his bag that really let him down.
