Waiting for sloooooow players ahead makes golfers stamp their feet, grit their teeth, lose their grip, throw their clubs in the water hazard and wish they were home watching golf on TV. The new “Troon Values Your Time” program encourages awareness of pace-of-play standards that help your round move along efficiently, making it enjoyable for everyone, not just for your Uncle Jake who hits the fairways only once a year. Time Par – Each Troon facility calculates its own Time Par by evaluating the appropriate length of time a golfer should comfortably play and enjoy the course. That Time Par is communicated to customers when booking their tee-time and in displays in the pro shop, on staff uniforms, on scorecards, yardage books, and on signage throughout the property. Yea! At the Westin Mission Hills Golf Resort and Spa and the Club at Savanna Harbor, the Time Par is 4 hours and 15 minutes. At the Makai Golf Club at Princeville, it’s 4 hours and 18 minutes; and at Indian Wells Golf Resort Celebrity Course, it’s 4 hours and 33 minutes. Pacesetter Times – Troon facilities are also implementing Pacesetter Times, which are designated morning tee times reserved for players committed to playing in at least 20 minutes under the facility’s Time Par. Get out there early and go for it! Pacesetter Tips: Play Your Tees: choose a set of tees with a rating of 142 minus your handicap index; or just tee it forward. Real men play from tees that match their abilities. Play Ready Golf (tee to green): at your ball or on the tee box and ready to play . . . . hit the darned thing! Take no more than 45 seconds to hit your shot. Be Cart Smart: drop off your partner and drive to your ball. When you leave the cart, take three clubs, not one. Park behind greens. Use Rules with Discretion: take no more than 3 minutes to look for balls and take relief. This is not the PGA Tour. Keep Moving: proceed quickly to your ball, choose your club and be ready when it’s your turn to hit. See It, Read It, Hole It: while others are putting, prepare for your putt, putt it and go on to the next tee. Be Accountable: slow play isn’t just the fault of other players. The faster you play, the sooner you get to the 19th hole. Founder/editor of BestGolfResortsofTheWorld.com, Karen Misuraca is a travel and golf writer from the California Wine Country.

In the fall of 2013, the JW Marriott Camelback Inn Resort & Spa in Phoenix will open the new, Ambiente golf course at Camelback Golf Club. The spectacular $10 million Ambiente course will complete a 7-year, $70 million renewal project at Camelback Inn, which involved: Preserving the resort’s 1930s adobe brick The renovation of 453 casita-style guestrooms A new 20,000 square-foot, hi-tech grand ballroom The debut of BLT Steak, Laurent Tourondel’s modern American steakhouse Replacing the old Indian Bend golf course, the Ambiente has stunning views of Mummy Mountain, Camelback, the McDowells and the Phoenix Mountain Preserve. Hurdzan/Fry Environmental Golf Design laid out rolling fairways with significant drops throughout the course, along with five sets of tee boxes, and massive greens averaging 122,000 square feet. The new track focuses on water and wildlife habitat conservation throughout, with 100 acres of native flora and a 50% percent decrease in pesticide, fertilizer and fossil fuel use as compared to the course it replaces. The existing, parkland-style Padre course is lovely with mature pine and eucalyptus trees and plenty of water hazards. Together, the two 18-hole courses comprise a golfer’s mecca in the Paradise Valley of Phoenix. Also at the luxury resort are 6 tennis courts, the 32,000-square-foot Spa at Camelback Inn, 2 swimming pools, and 7 restaurants and lounges. More here about golf in Phoenix/Scottsdale.

The youngest-ever competitor at The Masters, 14-year-old Guan Tianlang carded a fabulous 73 on the second day of competition--making the cut; he finished as the top amateur. Helping him prepare for the last 3 years was the team at Troon Golf Academy at  Lion Lake Country Club in Southern China, where a sprawling, new, state-of-the-art instructional complex and simulated Augusta-like course conditions gave Tianlang an advantage.Named "Best Golf Course Design" and "Best New Golf Club in China” when it opened recently, Lion Lake Country Club anchors the new Lion Lake resort and residential complex in the Pearl River Delta region of south China (a 1-hour drive from Guangzhou, and soon to be accessed by light rail). With flamboyant Arabian-style architecture and Vegas-style luxury, the Sheraton Qingyuan Lion Lake Resort has the catbird seat above the lakeside yacht club (on the drawing boards is a canal connecting to Hong Kong and Macau).Among the amenities surrounding the resort are a grass-skiing hillside, hot springs resort, boating on the lake and on an underground river, exploring a national forest park and ancient ruins--plus, of course, golf on the Troon Golf-operated Moon and Moonlight championship courses. The 7,115 yard, links-style Moon Course was laid around spectacular rocky escarpments and the lake, while the Moonlight Course features water-water everywhere.

Designed by Sir Nick Faldo, Laguna Lang Co Golf Club has opened on the Central Coast of Vietnam, which is becoming a major golf mecca. A short drive from the tourism capitals of Hue and Danang city, the Laguna Lang Co complex consists of the upscale golf club and two 5-star resorts, Banyan Tree and Angsana resorts, with more tourism development to come.With a soaring backdrop of the Truong Son mountain range and a dreamlike coastline, 6,958 yard Laguna Lang Co Golf Club meanders between tropical trees, rice paddys and streams, through rock features and alongside the beach. Sir Nick Faldo said, “There are six different environments, which give players an experience like no other – rice paddy, woodland, water, beach, sand and what I call ‘blowout’ areas. There’s something in it for everyone, as well as exceptional views all the way around. I believe it will hold up against the better courses in this region and maybe the world. The whole ambience of the course with a Banyan Tree resort makes it very special place.”Nearby lie the UNESCO World Heritage site in Hue; the picturesque, ancient town of Hoi, and the Cham Kingdom sanctuaries at My Son.Laguna Lang Co Golf Club has a fully stocked pro shop, really nice locker rooms, an expansive driving range and practice area, and restaurant. Review from a golfer: "Good course, top notch facilities, some of the best in Asia including locker rooms, practice range and restaurant. Service when I arrived was very personal, best greeting to a course I have ever had."

New owners, renovated golf courses, and expanded and refurbished infrastructure and activity programs have completely transformed Oahu's sprawling Turtle Bay Resort over the last couple of years. Less than an hour from the airport, the only resort on the North Shore, Turtle Bay is a long-established property on 840 mostly undeveloped acres of lush natural landscape, with 5 miles of shorefront consisting of little-known, sandy coves and some primo surfing beaches. Guests in 2013 will hardly notice that a complete renovation of more than 400 guest rooms and suites and the spa, will take place gradually over the year. Golfers will find no homes in sight to mar the pristine surroundings of the Arnold Palmer Course and the George Fazio Course, both now in top notch condition, with Paspalum greens and fairways meandering along beaches and wetlands and through gauzy ironwood groves. At 7,218 yards, the Palmer is a challenge even from low handicappers at 143/74.4 from the back tees, while mere mortals play 6,225, 5,574 and 4,851 from the gold, white and red tees; while the Fazio is somewhat more forgiving. A variety of golf packages for resort guests and daytrippers: 3-, 5- and 7-day Unlimited Golf Play Packages for Turtle Bay Resort Guests From $249 for a single and $339 for two for 3 days on both the Palmer and Fazio courses Group Golf Clinics for Resort Guests $30 each day; $100 for Mon-Fri clinics, each focusing on a different element of the game Tee It Up Afternoon Special for Resort Guests $65 on Fazio, $90 on Palmer, Mon-Fri after 2PM Includes green fees, golf car, Titleist rental equipment and a sleeve of Titleist golf balls Learn & Play $75 on Fazio, $100 on Palmer 11:00AM clinic, lunch at Lei Lei’s (purchased separately) From 2:00 p.m. on either the Fazio or Palmer, play unlimited golf including golf car, Titleist rental equipment and Titleist golf balls Palmer & Fazio Combo For either resort or non-resort guests Add $35 to the rate of the morning round (less expensive if you choose to challenge Fazio in the morning).

Turtle Bay Resort is managed by Benchmark Hospitality International, a company known for superior operation of such luxury properties as Bardessono in the Napa Valley, the Eldorado Hotel & Spa in Santa Fe, and Villas of Grand Cypress in Orlando.

The leading golf management company in the world, Troon Golf is supporting the 6th annual Patriot Golf Day, a joint initiative of The PGA of America and the United States Golf Association. Golfers playing at many Troon-managed facilities around the country will have the chance to donate $1 and more to benefit the Folds of Honor Foundation. Donations provide educational scholarships for children and spouses of military service men and women killed or disabled in the line of duty. "As we all know, freedom is not free, and we are proud to partner with Troon to help the families of our wounded and fallen heroes," said Major Dan Rooney, founder of Folds of Honor.  “Through Patriot Golf Day events held at thousands of facilities across the country, including Troon-managed facilities, we have given golfers a way to provide their support.” Since 2007, more than $12.8 million has been raised through Patriot Golf Day events, allowing Folds of Honor to award more than 3,500 educational scholarships. “Patriot Golf Day is a great opportunity for the golf industry to give back to the families of those who have courageously served to protect our country,” stated John Easterbrook of Troon Golf. Major Dan Rooney, a former F-16 fighter pilot, PGA Professional and USGA member, came up with the concept of Patriot Golf Day and founded the Folds of Honor Foundation in 2007, following his second of three tours of duty in Iraq. After returning from his second tour, Major Rooney witnessed a profound display of a family’s grief as they welcomed home the remains of Corporal Brock Bucklin. Inspired by this tragic homecoming of a fallen American solider, Rooney started the Folds of Honor Foundation to provide support to military families in the aftermath of their tragedies.

Piling award upon award,  The Boulders Resort in Carefree/Scottsdale, Arizona, is on the new “Best Golf Resorts in the U.S.” list on the golf travel website, the A Position. The resort is also a winner of Golf Magazine’s “Platinum Medal” award as one of the “Top 10 US Courses” and on Golfweek’s “Best Courses, State-by-State”. One of two stunning Jay Morrish-designed courses, the North Course rambles into vibrantly colored rock formations, rugged canyons and arroyos. Cooing doves and quail, roadrunners, fat Gila monsters, deer and the occasional bobcat and coyote roam the groves of cacti and the rocky streambeds (the "coyote rule" allows you to replay a shot without penalty when a coyote grabs your ball). A dozen doglegs and generous fairways careen across a rolling desert to super-fast greens. Towering cacti and giant boulders are so distinctive and sizable that they are marked in the yardage booklet. On 17, a monster rock stands in the middle of a greenside bunker.  7,007 yards from the tips, the South Course has a bracing 73.3/146 rating/slope. Forced carries and elevated tees show off the desert splendor along narrow fairways lined with 6-story-tall boulders and ancient saguaros, dry washes and sandy waste areas. On the signature "Boulder Pile" 5th hole, the green lies below a tremendous bastion of boulders. While fairways and shoulders are mowed short, off the turf in the low brush and cacti, you're dead. The starter hints at some interesting indigenous fauna: "You are welcome to hit out of the rough, but, bring a stick." Two solutions are available to combat the challenges of “desert target golf”.  #1: schedule a lesson at The Boulders Golf Academy with Donald Crawley, named among Golf Magazine's “Top 100 Teachers in America.” #2: The Boulders has recently created two new faster-play layouts that are perfect for busy visitors who have only an hour to spare and for less experienced golfers. The new courses feature yardages of 100--200 yards and were created by installing new “pebble tees.”  The short courses are available for play (afternoons only) with rates from $65 during peak season (January-May). A Waldorf Astoria Resort, The Boulders is Southwestern luxury defined, with 160 guest casitas and 61 one-, two- and three-bedroom villas, 7 restaurants, 8 tennis courts and the full-service, world-famous Golden Door Spa. Your Choice Golf or Spa package: luxury casita accommodations daily choice of unlimited golf or $150 spa credit (per adult) $25/person food & beverage credit Click here for more about The Boulders Founder/editor of BestGolfResortsofTheWorld.com,  Karen Misuraca is a travel and golf writer from the California Wine Country.

For the first time in over a century, the Presidio Golf Club in San Francisco is offering an amazing deal for new club memberships:  a waived initial registration fee of $12,000.   Private club members receive: Unlimited Golf with preferred tee times Monthly tournament play Unlimited use of swing simulator & gym equipment Access to clubhouse locker room Complimentary club storage & club cleaning  Discounts on merchandise, resort golf & lodging Invitations to attend social events Club members also enjoy private clubhouse dining and event space. Established in 1896, the Presidio Golf Course was the much-coveted private sanctuary of the U.S. Army until 1995, when the Army base became part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and the golf course became semi-private. A multi-million dollar upgrade by Arnold Palmer Golf Management Company added bentgrass greens, a glitzy new clubhouse and the Presidio Cafe on the 18th green, where golfers enjoy live jazz and California cuisine on the heated terrace. On a peninsula of woodlands and buffs above the Golden Gate, the 6,500-yard track winds among stands of towering cypress, eucalyptus and pines. Peregrine falcons and eagles circle above, and wild rhododendrons explode into clouds of red and white blooms from January through April. Sidehill, uphill and downhill lies are the order of the day, plus erratic winds off San Francisco Bay.   Founder/editor of BestGolfResortsofTheWorld.com,  Karen Misuraca is a travel and golf writer from the California Wine Country.

Look for views of Yosemite National Park and the snow-capped Sierra Nevadas from the 18 holes of championship golf at Saddle Creek Resort in California’s Gold Country. The Carter Morrish-designed, meandering layout is scattered with lakes and 100+ bunkers, and menaced by the arms of huge valley oaks, a criss-crossing creek and multi-level greens. The resort continues to gain awards, including 16th best public access course in the state of by Golfweek Magazine in 2012; Golf Digest voted it 7th best new upscale golf course in the U.S., rating 4.5 stars.

// Of the 39 golf courses on Oahu, Ko'olau Golf Club at Kaneohe is by far the scariest—Golf Digest has called it the third toughest in America. At foot of the Pali Lookout on the windward side of the 2,000-foot Ko'olau Ridge mountain range, the course is a 7,310-yard Shangri-La of luxuriant rainforest, jungly gorges, winding ravines, big-time elevation changes, dramatic waterfalls and mountains gone green from over a hundred inches of annual rainfall. Although a 152 slope rating from the back tees indicates a daunting challenge, the other tees are positioned to offer a pleasant experience to the average player (bring your camera). Nonetheless, the 18th hole is not for sissies—long carries must fly over two bottomless canyons while avoiding 22 sandy traps. After their rounds, golfers stagger into the clubhouse to enjoy ocean views and Don Ho's Special Ramen Noodles at Honey's at Ko'olau, the restaurant named for Honey Ho, a popular local who was the mother of Honolulu’s most famous entertainer, the late Don Ho. President Obama lived here in the Kaneohe area in his early life, and he and his family spend some of their vacations here; he and his entourage last played at Ko’olau in December, 2011.

Founded in 1886, Royal Lytham & St Annes Golf Club is hosting its eleventh Open Championship this week. In Lancashire, northwest England, on what is known as the country’s “Golf Coast”, the club has seen some smashing victories by legends of golf from Bobby Jones, Bob Charles and Tony Jacklin to Gary Player, Seve Ballesteros, Tom Lehman, and David Duval in 2001.Not a typical Open Championship venue, this is the only British Open course that begins with a par-3, the only one with three par-3s on the front nine, and the only one with houses on three sides (the homes are mostly screened by dense thickets of trees). A railway line––out of bounds––runs along several holes. You can’t see the ocean, yet stiff sea winds definitely come into play. A traditional links layout, the course is notorious for knee-high rough, and for 206 fearsome bunkers––seventeen on the 18th hole alone. Many are constructed with high, nearly vertical stacked turf walls that make sand shots nearly impossible for all but the pros. Mere mortals have to hit out the back or side of the bunkers just to survive.We had the eye-opening experience of watching groundsmen reconstruct some stacked bunkers while we played the track. Uniquely skilled at the job, they nonetheless were tuckered and covered in mud by the time they completed each bunker.Golfers from around the world make their pilgrimages to the museum-like, impressive brick and half-timbered clubhouse. Upstairs a lifelike portrait of Bobby Jones looms above the famous mashie iron with which he won the 1926 Open. On the final day on the 17th, Jones shanked his drive into sandy scrub, while his opponent, Al Watrous, found the green in two and looked like a sure winner. Jones zoomed out of the rough, landing close to the hole, and won the Open. A plaque next to the bunker on the 17th fairway commemorates the event. At the 1979 Open, Seve Ballesteros landed in just about every gorse bush and pot bunker on the track. On the 16th, he hit from a parking lot, and with Nicklaus just one shot behind and heading fore a birdie on the 18th, Seve hit a wedge out of the dust to 15 feet and holed the putt as Nicklaus missed his. Ballesteros was back in 1988, with the same clubs and the same clothes. The final round was carried over to Monday after severe flooding, and Seve shot a course record 65 to win, which he claimed was the best round of his life.If you get the chance to play Royal Lytham, save some time to browse the photos, the showcases of memorabilia and the rooms in the clubhouse, and have lunch in the dining room overlooking the 18th green. And don’t fail to belly up to the bar with some of the members, who are welcoming and full of great stories and jokes. With advance reservations, you can stay at charming Dormy House (beds for up to 16 male guests in single rooms). You’ll find the yardage booklet just so sweet, with color illustration of various hazards and greenery on the course, from gorse (don’t even think of getting out of that––you’ll be torn to shreds), rhododendron bushes, hedges, mounds, hollows and streams.Nearby are the iconic British Open courses of Royal Birkdale(founded 1889) and Royal Liverpool (founded 1869), and 17 more golf courses on England’s Golf Coast.

Early summer is a great time to see wildlife in the Canadian Rockies, when magenta and blue lupine line the fairways of the stunning Fairmont Chateau Whistler Golf Club.   Black bears are often sighted munching on wild berries in the deep rough, while coyotes and deer stand their ground on the edges of the Douglas fir forest. Golfers bring their binoculars and cameras for the daily pageant of golden eagles, swooping osprey and resident pileated woodpeckers. Within the vavcation village of Whistler at the foot of the dramatic Coast Mountain range in British Columbia, the Robert Trent Jones, Jr.-designed Chateau Whistler course lies on tilting terrain studded with monumental granite outcroppings. Cascading across the track are three glacier-fed streams, spawning grounds for Rainbow and Kokanee trout.  Unlimited Golf Package at the Fairmont Chateau Whistler for summer 2012: luxury accommodations unlimited golf Kids are Free (up to age 16 per 1 paying adult) from $229 CAD per person per day (double occupancy) June through September Annual events in charming, Euro-style, pedestrian-only Whistler village range from all-summer, live street-side entertainment to World Beat Weekend, the First Nations Festival and Jazz and Blues Weekend.

<li><a href='http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/bestgolf/~3/uOQiHwU13kw/golf-on-amelia-island-florida.html' target="_blank">Golf on Amelia Island, Florida</a><br />
Across the St. Marys River from Georgia, the barrier island of Amelia Island lies between Atlantic Coast beaches and the Intracoastal Waterway. Unlike most destination resorts in Florida, the island is privately owned, secluded and protected by a gated entry. Lush, green marshlands and low marine forests cover the island, and one is never far from the sight and sound of the ocean. Condominiums, two resort hotels and residential developments are scattered on narrow roads beneath a shady canopy of oaks, palms, pines and tropical vegetation, along miles of duney beaches. Tom Fazio, Pete Dye and Bobby Weed laid the Long Point, Ocean Links and Oak Marsh golf courses within maritime forest and marshlands; each is designated an Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary. Wrapped like a green velvet shawl between the ocean and the waterway, Long Point is Tom Fazio's inspired design in a setting of tidal marshes, towering sand dunes and a dense pine and oak forest. Natural waste bunkers, grass basins and deep pot bunkers guard rolling fairways and large, elevated greens. Mounds and moguls along the fairways prevent balls from flying into the impenetrable tree barrier and water hazards. Among several long carries, the second hole requires a 230-yard fly over  wetlands to a wide zone that narrows between savannah and the water to an almost blind putting surface surrounded by deep hollows. The Amelia River and the salt marshes are rich wildlife habitat, where Great egrets, wood storks, kingfishers killdeer and gulls are beautiful distractions. A private club except for resort guests, Long Point is set serenely apart, with its own clubhouse, restaurant and  golf school. Serpentine salt marshes and creeks come into play on many holes of Pete Dye-designed Oak Marsh, where accurate shot placement is called for on skinny fairways and small, bulkheaded greens bordered closely by hammock groves and moss-draped cypress and oak trees. Dye uttered an understatement about Oak Marsh: "we've left the rough in its natural state. Only the areas of play are manicured." A good short game and efficient approach shots are called for on Ocean Links, a Dye/Weed track just 6,300 yards from the back tees. 7 seaside holes are predictably breezy, while 10 holes are menaced by marshy wetlands and lagoons, meandering through a unique coastal hammock. Greens are small, dipped, swaled and tilted. Royal Amelia Golf Links is a parkland layout designed around small lakes, a creek and a forest of palmettos, myrtles, Southern pine and oak; fairways and greens are gigantic on this 6,850 yard track. Surprises include a peninsula green on 17n and a palm tree smack in the middle of the 2nd hole. The clubhouse verandah is a good perch from which to contemplate the sunset over the tidal marsh and the waterway. Within of the surrounding private community of Summer Beach, the Golf Club of Amelia Island, adjacent to the Ritz Carlton Amelia Island, is a Mark McCumber/Gene Littler design open to members and resort guests. Wide rolling fairways, marshlands and lakes, oaks, palms and acres of sand dunes comprise the story here. Where to Stay on Amelia IslandThe 4-diamond rated Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort is undergoing n $85 million renovation to be completed in Spring, 2013.   The Villas of Amelia Island Plantation are comprised of 1, 2 and 3 bedroom units in several beachfront, medium-rise buildings, with extensive family recreation within walking distance. The Ritz Carlton, Amelia Island sits elegantly above a 1.5-mile beach lapped with calm waters; little kids splash in the warm lagoons here at low tide. Guests staying in the 444 ocean view rooms and suites enjoy priority tee times at the Golf Club of Amelia Island, and tee times can be arranged golf at the other island courses. A full-service spa, nine oceanside, lighted tennis courts, three restaurants, and indoor/outdoor pools complete the package. More here about golf in Florida. And more golf in Florida.

At 214 feet below sea level, the course is located in North America’s hottest and driest location.

Awarded entry in Golf Magazine’s 2012 Eco-friendly Green Hall of Fame are three iconic American golf resorts: The Resort at Pelican Hill in Southern California Bandon Dunes Golf Resort in Oregon Kingsmill Resort and Spa in Williamsburg, VA Chosen from many top notch candidates, these three pay exceptional attention to resource conservation and protection, water management, wildlife habitat and restoration, and other on-going eco-programs. On 504 acres above the Pacific Ocean in Newport Beach, The Resort at Pelican Hill saves more than 50 million gallons of water a year, while protecting and restoring coastal sage scrub and other indigenous flora. 1.2 million gallons of rain and runoff water is captured and held, and the sprinkler system monitors temperature, humidity and other factors to determine watering needs. Reclaimed water is used on the golf courses and landscaping, which is common, these days, on many, if not most, golf courses. More here about The Resort at Pelican Hill. A unique 13-hole, par-3 track adjacent to the four Scottish links-style courses that have made Bandon Dunes Golf Resort world famous, the new Bandon Preserve Golf Course (to open May 2012), is a Coore-Crenshaw design. Net proceeds from Preserve will benefit The Wild Rivers Coast Alliance, which supports projects that protect lands and waters of The South Coast of Oregon. The Preserve will also protect and preserve the Silvery Phacelia, an endangered plant species. Four-diamond-rated Kingsmill Resort & Spa has dedicated 40% of its 2,900 acres overlooking the James River to eco‐friendly initiatives. The Woods, River and Plantation courses are each Certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuaries, wherein the habitatsof bald eagles, hawks, and other endangered birds are protected. Rain water and irrigation runoff is funneled from parking lots, roadways and golf courses into irrigation ponds, from where it is used to water the golf courses and landscaping; and Kingsmill’s marina landscaping is fertilizer- and pesticide-free. Each year, the resort recycles nearly 35 tons of aluminum, 12 tons of cardboard, 4 tons of cooking oil, and 1.25 tons of paper. More here about Kingsmill Resort.
