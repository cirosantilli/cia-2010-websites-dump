By Alistair Lyon and Tom Finn CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt&#039;s deputy prime minister will propose a way out of a bloody confrontation between the security forces and deposed President Mohamed Mursi&#039;s Muslim Brotherhood when the cabinet discusses the crisis on Sunday. But his ideas seemed to run counter to a suggestion by the prime minister to dissolve the Islamist organization, the target of a crackdown by the army-backed government last week.

By Rolando Ng TALISAY, Philippines (Reuters) - As rescuers plucked more bodies from the sea after a Philippine ferry and a cargo ship collided late last week, killing at least 38 people, a vexing but familiar question faces a country plagued by an abysmal record in maritime safety: what went wrong? Authorities say 82 people listed as missing are believed to have died, trapped in the ferry that sank to the sea floor off the central Philippine port of Cebu minutes after Friday&#039;s collision. Divers are trying to cut into the vessel, at a depth of 45 meters (150 feet), and plug an oil leak.

By Fiona Ortiz GIBRALTAR (Reuters) - The people of tiny Gibraltar - a wealthy British enclave perched on a rocky outcrop near Spain&#039;s southern tip - have a tradition of griping about their big neighbor, which claims the territory as its own. But the tetchy relationship has taken a sharp nosedive as an escalating spat over fishing has interrupted a decade of relative calm, igniting concerns that Gibraltar&#039;s tourism and port industries could be hurt.

DAMASCUS (Reuters) - A team of United Nations chemical weapons experts arrived in Damascus on Sunday to investigate the possible use of chemical weapons in Syria&#039;s civil war. President Bashar al-Assad&#039;s government and the rebels fighting him have accused each other of using chemical weapons, a step which the United States had said would cross a &quot;red line&quot; in a conflict which has killed 100,000 people. Like the broader Syrian conflict, the issue of chemical weapons has divided world powers.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya's Interior Minister Mohammed Khalifa al-Sheikh submitted his resignation on Sunday over differences with the prime minister, a parliament member and an official at the prime minister's office said. Lawlessness has blighted large areas of Libya following the 2011 war that toppled Muammar Gaddafi and the North African Arab country is still awash with weapons.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said on Sunday it had accepted a South Korean offer to hold working-level talks on resuming reunions of families separated by the Korean War, three days after an overture by South Korean President Park Geun-hye. Reclusive North Korea's decision comes amid easing tensions between North and South, technically still at war after their 1950-53 civil conflict ended in a mere truce, not a treaty.
