      <p><strong>Iran's Premier Football League</strong> known as the <strong>Iran Premier League (IPL)</strong> and now officially as the <strong>Persian Gulf Cup</strong> is the most important football league in Iran. IPL is really one of many steps in the evolution of Iranian league football. The league system resembles the system being used in England currently. The Premier league is the top league, then follows the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azadegan_League">1st division</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Football%27s_2nd_Division">2nd division</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Football%27s_3rd_Division">3rd Division</a> and the lower local leagues.</p>

      <h1 class="style1">History </h1>
      <h2 class="style2">Pre-1970s </h2>
      <p>Before the early 1970's Iran did not have an official national league. Most teams would participate in city championships. Taj and Persepolis had become the two most popular teams in the mid 60s and continue to be in the present. Pas, Shahin, Taj, Daraei FC, all won championships in the Tehran local league, during this period.</p>
      <h2 class="style1">Takht Jamshid Cup </h2>
      <p>In 1972, the Takht Jamshid Cup was created. It was designed to include teams from all over the country, but as usual teams from Tehran dominated, mostly Pas, winning the final two. The league was in place until the Iranian Revolution took place, and the 1978 season was left uncompleted.</p>
      <h1 class="style1">1980s </h1>
      <p>Due to the revolution and the Iran-Iraq War, football was no longer a priority. Clubs had very little money and due to political reasons team names, management and resources were changed. There was no major league competition during the 1980-89 period, only a few cup competitions and some local city league championships such as the 17th of Shahrivar league and the Qods Cup. In 1989 the Qods league was created and saw Esteghlal as its champion.</p>
      <h1 class="style1">Azadegan League</h1> 
      <p>In 1991 the Qods league was renamed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azadegan_League">Azadegan League</a>. Named the Azadegan League in honor of Iranian prisoners of war who were released, it began operations in the 1991-92 season. Pas was its first champion. For the first time in more than ten years Iran finally had a national league again. The number of teams playing in the league varied from year to year. Pas and Saipa dominated the league in the first four years. Pas and Esteghlal both were able to capture Asian Club Championships in the early 1990s. By the mid-90s Persepolis and Esteghlal regained their dominant form. The league championship every year between 1995-2001 was either Esteghlal or Persepolis. The two clubs always had the most talented players in Iran, the national team consisted mainly of Perspolis and Esteghlal players, and some of the greatest talents Iranian football has seen were discovered during this period.<p>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Ipl200.png" title="IPL Logo (2001-2006)"><img border="0" width="108" height="108" src="images/footballleaguesytem_clip_image007.gif" alt="IPL Logo (2001-2006)"></a><br>

      <h1 class="style1">IPL: Iranian Premier League </h1>
      <p>The 2001-2002 season saw the beginning of the first professional football league in Iran. Unfortunately many say that the new league is professional in name only and is missing many of the required components of a pro league. Player salaries have risen and other positives in the league are the emergence of provincial teams and raw talent which every IPL team boasts. Teams like Foolad Sepahan, Foolad Khouzestan and Zob Ahan FC have all shown they can compete, even though they are not based in Tehran. The league can only continue to get better, and many are hoping this league  will help Iran's football, in terms of quality and reputation improve.</p>
      <h1 class="style1">Persian Gulf Cup </h1>
    <p>On August 12, 2006, the Iranian Football Federation decided to change the name of the league once again. The name of the league now is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> Cup. This was done to promote the name of the Persian Gulf, instead of the incorrect variations which some nations and organizations use. The league logo was also changed, with the winner selected from over 130 designs being unveiled on November 14, 2006.
