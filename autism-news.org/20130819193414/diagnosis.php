		<h2>What are some common signs of autism?</h2>

		<p>There are three distinctive behaviors that characterize autism.    Autistic children have difficulties 

		with social interaction, problems with verbal and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors or narrow, 

		obsessive interests.  These behaviors can range in impact from mild to disabling.</p>

		<p>The hallmark feature of autism is impaired social interaction.  Parents are usually the first to notice 

		symptoms of autism in their child.  As early as infancy, a baby with autism may be unresponsive to people 

		or focus intently on one item to the exclusion of others for long periods of time.  A child with autism 

		may appear to develop normally and then withdraw and become indifferent to social engagement.</p>

		<p>Children with autism may fail to respond to their name and often avoid eye contact with other people. 

		They have difficulty interpreting what others are thinking or feeling because they can’t understand social cues, 

		such as tone of voice or facial expressions, and don’t watch other people’s faces for clues about 

		appropriate behavior.  They lack empathy.</p>

		<p>Many children with autism engage in repetitive movements such as rocking and twirling, 

		or in self-abusive behavior such as biting or head-banging.  They also tend to start speaking 

		later than other children and may refer to themselves by name instead of “I” or “me.”  

		Children with autism don’t know how to play interactively with other children.  Some speak 

		in a sing-song voice about a narrow range of favorite topics, with little regard for the 

		interests of the person to whom they are speaking.</p>

		<p>Many children with autism have a reduced sensitivity to pain, but are abnormally sensitive 

		to sound, touch, or other sensory stimulation.  These unusual reactions may contribute to 

		behavioral symptoms such as a resistance to being cuddled or hugged.</p>

		<p>Children with autism appear to have a higher than normal risk for certain co-existing conditions, 

		including fragile X syndrome (which causes mental retardation), tuberous sclerosis (in which tumors 

		grow on the brain), epileptic seizures, Tourette syndrome, learning disabilities, and attention 

		deficit disorder.  For reasons that are still unclear, about 20 to 30 percent of children with 

		autism develop epilepsy by the time they reach adulthood.  While people with schizophrenia 

		may show some autistic-like behavior, their symptoms usually do not appear until the late 

		teens or early adulthood.  Most people with schizophrenia also have hallucinations and 

		delusions, which are not found in autism.</p>

    <h2>Autism: Signs and Symptoms</h2>

<p>Children with

  autism and other autism spectrum disorders typically display a range of

  identifiable symptoms. By being aware of these signs, parents can help spot the

  disorder at an earlier age, which greatly improves a child’s overall prognosis.</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>Delay in, or total lack of, development of spoken language<br>

  -- Difficulty initiating conversation<br>

  -- Echolalia (repeating words or phrases instead of using normal language)<br>

  -- Doesn’t respond to name<br>

  -- Doesn’t use or respond to gestures and other nonverbal cues</p>

<h3>Social Interaction</h3>

<p>Doesn’t point to objects or show them to others<br>

  -- Doesn’t make eye contact at appropriate times<br>

  -- Doesn’t look at other people’s faces as much<br>

  -- Doesn’t respond to facial expressions or body language<br>

  -- Doesn’t smile back at others<br>

  -- Lack of peer relationships appropriate to age level<br>

  -- Less interest in other children<br>

  -- Not motivated by praise or physical affection<br>

  -- Doesn’t clearly demonstrate sympathy or empathy</p>

<h3>Behaviors</h3>

<p>Engages in highly repetitive play<br>

  -- Obsessively preoccupied with a specific interest or object<br>

  -- Lack of make-believe or imitative play<br>

  -- Dependent on routines, rituals and familiarity<br>

  -- Repetitive body movements (hand or finger flapping, eye rolling, twisting,

  spinning, rocking, etc.)<br>

  -- Preoccupation with parts of objects<br>

  -- Easily overstimulated by noises, crowds or lights<br>

  -- Extreme dislike of certain sounds, textures or situations<br>

  -- Doesn’t have strong response to pain</p>

<h3>Increase in diagnoses of autism</h3><p class="info">Source: Wikipedia.org</p>

<p class="right"><img src="images/family-taking-walk.jpg" alt="family walk" />The number of reported cases of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade.There has been an explosion 

worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years. In the last decade, the population of the United States 

has increased by 13%. There has been an increase in non-autism-related disabilities of 16%. The increase in autism is 173%.

There has been considerable speculation as to why this might be, with no conclusive proof emerging around any theory. 

Epidemiologists argue that the rise is either partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria, 

reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to tap into federally mandated services.</p>

 

<p>A widely cited study from the M.I.N.D. Institute in California (Oct 17, 2002), concluded that the increase is real, 

even after those complicating factors are accounted for. Other researchers remain unconvinced, including 

Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center at San Antonio 

and co-chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Autism Expert Panel, who says, 

“There is a chance we’re seeing a true rise, but right now I don’t think anybody can answer that question for sure.” 

(Newsweek reference below).</p>



<p>The answer to this question has significant ramifications on the direction of research, since a real increase 

would focus more attention (and research funding) on the search for environmental factors, while a consensus 

for little or no real increase would direct more attention to genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable 

that certain environmental factors (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may have a particular impact on people 

with a specific genetic constitution.</p>

 

<p>There is little public research on the effects of in-vitro fertilization on the number of incidences of autism.</p>

This is only one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior. Shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism or Asperger's syndrome.</li>
