  TODAY critic <b><a href="autism_more">Deirdre Donahue</a></b> examines five new books that deal with this bewildering

  disorder.  (February 18, 2007)</p>

<p><b>Unstrange</b><b> Minds: Remapping the World of Autism </b></p>

<p>By Roy Richard Grinker <br>

  Basic Books, 340 pp., $26.95</p>

<p>Hands down, <i>Unstrange</i><i> Minds </i>is the most useful book of

  the bunch for anyone who is interested in learning more about autism. The

  father of an autistic teenage daughter, Grinker is

  also a professor of anthropology at George Washington University. He skillfully combines his daughter Isabel's story

  with an accessible historical and cultural examination of how people with

  autism have been diagnosed and treated in the

  <st1:country-region>USA</st1:country-region>

  and around the world. Autism is seen as a range of

  problems that involve impairments in three areas: social interaction,

  communication and imagination. He writes, &quot;They are so variable in their

  severity that one person with autism might be profoundly mentally retarded and

  totally non-verbal while another might be a physics professor.&quot; Grinker convincingly argues that the &quot;autism

  epidemic&quot; is actually the result of more accurate detection by doctors and

  schools.</p>

<p><b>George &amp; Sam: Two

  Boys, One Family, and Autism </b></p>

<p>By Charlotte Moore,

  foreword by Nick Hornby <br>

  St. Martin's, 296 pp., $24.95</p>

<p>English writer Moore puts

  her unusual family under a microscope in this moving book. Her two oldest sons,

  George and Sam, are autistic; her youngest is not. As exhausting and difficult

  as this situation is for Moore,

  it makes for a book that is extremely helpful in conveying the enormous

  differences in how autism affects children. One autistic son is very verbal;

  the other has limited language. One is anxious, and one is fearless about

  running away. <i>George &amp; Sam</i> also illustrates how certain therapies

  can work well with one and do nothing for the other. At the end of the book,

  the reader feels he really knows the boys as interesting individuals. Despite

  their sleep disorders, educational needs, disruptive behaviors and lifelong

  need for constant care, her two older sons clearly provide Moore with satisfaction. </p>

<p><b>Born on a Blue Day:

  Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant </b></p>

<p>By Daniel Tammet <br>

  Free Press, 226 pp, $24</p>

<p>When author Tammet met the real-life inspiration for Dustin Hoffman's

  character in <i>Rain Man</i>, he felt a connection: Both men share an

  extraordinary facility with numbers. Tammet and his

  remarkable mind have been studied by scientists. The 28-year-old Englishman has

  become a media darling, appearing on TV shows such as <i>Late Show With David

    Letterman </i>and <i>60 Minutes</i> Tammet became

  famous by memorizing and reciting the number pi to 22,514 digits. At 25, he was

  diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a term applied to

  high-functioning people with autism. In his memoir, Tammet describes his childhood: Though school came easily, making friends was

  difficult. An accepting family, a sympathetic lover, the

  ability to work from home and the Internet have all helped Tammet. </p>

<p><b>Strange Son: Two Mothers,

  Two Sons, and the Quest to Unlock the Hidden World of Autism </b></p>

<p>By Portia Iversen <br>

  Riverhead, 197 pp., $24.95</p>

<p>Dynamic and driven, author Iversen co-founded Cure Autism Now. A Hollywood writer and set director, Iversen narrates how

  her son Dov's autism diagnosis in 1994 galvanizes her

  and her husband to seek out scientists and legislators to push for more

  research. The memoir also details how Iversen made

  contact with a mother of an autistic boy in

  <st1:country-region>India</st1:country-region>

  , Soma Mukhopadhyay.

  Although Soma's son Tito is autistic, he is also a gifted poet and writer. (His

  book <i>The Mind Tree </i>was published this month.) He communicates through a

  computer keyboard. Iversen brought the mother and son

  to the

  <st1:country-region>USA</st1:country-region>

  , where the mother is sharing her technique with

  other autistic children, including Dov. Tito has been

  studied by scientists for insights into autism. (His IQ is 185.) Film rights to <i>Strange Son </i>have been sold.</p>

<p><b>Mozart and the Whale:

  An Asperger's Love Story </b></p>

<p>By Jerry and Mary Newport

  with Johnny Dodd <br>

  Touchstone, 265 pp., $24.95</p>

<p>For a brief period, Jerry

  and Mary Newport served as the media's poster couple for &quot;Aspies&quot; in love, to employ the word the Newports use for people like them. The couple appeared on

  the front page of <i>The </i><i>Los Angeles</i><i> Times. </i>The

  TV newsmagazine <i>60 Minutes </i>profiled them, and they met with Steven

  Spielberg and Robin Williams for a movie project. That didn't happen; the

  eventual 2005 film <i>Mozart and the Whale</i> was directed by Petter Naess and starred Josh

  Hartnett and Radha Mitchell. The media spin: Two lonely,

  gifted, differently wired people with Asperger's found joy together. Reality was not so simple: this joint memoir details each

  of their painful childhoods, their struggles to find work despite being

  talented (he is math savant, she is artistic), their emotional isolation, their

  suicide attempts, their sense of being freaks, their

  self-hatred, their divorce and remarriage. </p>
