			<h2>Events</h2>

			<p>2002 was declared Autism Awareness Year in the United Kingdom

			 - this idea was initiated by Ivan and Charika Corea, parents of an autistic child, Charin. 

			 Autism Awareness Year was led by the British Institute of Brain Injured Children, 

			 Disabilities Trust, National Autistic Society, Autism London and 800 organizations 

			 in the United Kingdom. It had the personal backing of the British Prime Minister 

			 Tony Blair and parliamentarians of all parties in the Palace of Westminster.</p>

		<p>Autistic Pride Day, an initiative from Aspies For Freedom, is on 18 June each year, 

		starting in 2005. It is to celebrate the positive side of being autistic and having Asperger's, 

		to raise awareness of issues relating to autism, and to seek acceptance for differences, 

		with an aim to bring an end to discrimination. It is hoped that events will be held worldwide, 

		such as parades, marches, and parties. The theme for 2005 is "Acceptance not cure", 

		the main event is a parade in Seattle, Washington,USA.</p>

	<h2>Treatment</h2>		

           <p class="right"><img src="images/boy_floor.jpg" alt="boy on floor coloring" />There is no cure for autism. Therapies and behavioral interventions are designed

            to remedy specific symptoms and can bring about substantial improvement. The ideal

            treatment plan coordinates therapies and interventions that target the core symptoms

            of autism: impaired social interaction, problems with verbal and nonverbal communication,

            and obsessive or repetitive routines and interests. Most professionals agree that

            the earlier the intervention, the better.</p>            

			<h3>Educational/behavioral interventions</h3>

			<p>Therapists use highly structured and

              intensive skill-oriented training sessions

              to help children develop social and language

              skills. Family counseling for the parents

              and siblings of children with autism

              often helps families cope with the particular

              challenges of living with an autistic

              child. </p>

            <h3>Medications</h3>

			<p class="right"><img src="images/pills.jpg" alt="pills" />Doctors often prescribe

              an antidepressant medication to handle

              symptoms of anxiety, depression, or obsessive-compulsive

              disorder. Anti-psychotic medications

              are used to treat severe behavioral problems.

              Seizures can be treated with one or more

              of the anticonvulsant drugs. Stimulant

              drugs, such as those used for children

              with attention deficit disorder (ADD),

              are sometimes used effectively to help

              decrease impulsivity and hyperactivity. </p>

            <h3>Other therapies</h3>

			<p>There are a number of controversial therapies or interventions

              available for autistic children, but

              few, if any, are supported by scientific

              studies. Parents should use caution before

              adopting any of these treatments.</p>
