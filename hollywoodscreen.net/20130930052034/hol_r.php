It takes a certain kind of man to drive what amounts to a mobile bomb - one that guarantees a 20% of death in every race. That was the odds facing every Formula One driver in the 1970s - and two such drivers, the hot-headed, loose cannon playboy James Hunt and the efficient, by-the-books serious Austrian Niki Lauda developed one of the greatest rivalries in this or any sport. Both men couldn't <i><a href="http://www.filmcrave.com/movie_page_main.php?id=44322">read more</a></i><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FCMovieReviews/~4/kTDSrPOWKjI" height="1" width="1"/>

Last year a film named 'Les Miserables' was released in cinemas. Hugh Jackman was nominated in the Best Actor category at the Academy Awards.&#8232; He did not win.&#8232; And now he wants his Oscar.&#8232;&#8232; Let us start with the acting.&#8232; There is one performance that I thought was great in this film, namely that of Jake Gyllenhaal's.

i reallly like Formula 1. Still I hadn't had this movie on my list. Why? It is darn good. The movie begins with exetremly loud noises. Race cars. Then the sounds gets a bit quiet and Niki Lauda/Daniel Brühl (I'm not that sure, sorry) speaks some words. Brilliant sound mixing. This keeps up throughout the whole movie. The sound mixing and editing is not to loud and not to low.

'Prisoners' is a heavily dramatic crime film laden with a mysterious and harsh atmosphere. A closer sense of realism overshadows this film. It's dark, and slower paced, but never ceases in delivering edge-of-your-seat entertainment. This is due to the high level of involvement that I felt watching this case being solved and for the palpable emotional weight delivered by the characters.

Considering how bad a rap Nicolas Cage has got recently in terms of his choice of movies, my expectations weren't particularly high for this serial killer thriller. And although no one is likely to win any acting awards for this one, I have to say that on the whole Frozen Ground keeps the tension ramped up and in the end is a decent film, especially for those who like true crime dramas.

It has been a very long time since we have seen an excellent mysterythriller, that is not directed by Christopher Nolan. This movie is dark. Like, very dark. Even the weather is. Ít all makes the mood fit to the topic. The cast is pushing the movie up and makes even more dark. The movie just lives from Jackman an Gyllenhaal, they both give Oscar-worthy performances. They even make Terrence H <i><a href="http://www.filmcrave.com/movie_page_main.php?id=48148">read more</a></i><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FCMovieReviews/~4/mWZtv8DJEy8" height="1" width="1"/>

Here is one high school age drama that feels realistic in it's character's personalities, their romantic relationship, and their emotions. I found many aspects of this film to be relatable, mostly from Teller's character. He and Woodley share many genuine scenes together. The believability in their performances is amplified as they become closer to one another.

Riddick is crowned king of his enemies, the all- conquering cult the Necromongers but gets betrayed by his jealous rival Vaako (Karl Urban returning for a one-scene cameo) while searching for his original home planet of Furya. Kicked off a cliff in a desolate alien-infested planet, he is forced to seek shelter from the harsh rocky landscape and the vicious alien creatures that inhabit it.

Insidious scared the crap out of me. Back in 2011 when I left Insidious' big screening room, it struck me that James Wan (who made this year's fantastic The Conjuring. And Dead Silence) is a true talent. He understands tension - what creates it and how to build it. He earns his scares. He establishes a dreading atmosphere that oozes with grueling horror and intensity.

'Insidious: Chapter 2' is easily one of the best horror sequels I've seen in a long time. A true continuation of the first and not just a re-hash of old for the sake of making money (like most sequels these days). The story continues onward from where we left off, provides a prequel segment, adds some interesting mythology, and even revisits scenes from the first from a different perspective.
