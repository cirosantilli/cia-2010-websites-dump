The 51st <a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/nyff2013">New York Film Festival</a> opened this weekend with <em><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/captain_phillips/"><strong>Captain Phillips</strong></em></a>, <em>Bourne Ultimatum</em> director Paul Greengrass's tension-riddled retelling of a true story in which an American cargo ship was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009. Tom Hanks plays the besieged skipper, Rich Phillips, with newcomer Barkhad Abdi leading the band of pirates. RT was there as both actors joined Greengrass for a chat about the making of the film, staying true to the essence of the events -- and that time the seasick crew threw up all over Hanks. Let no one say that acting isn't hard work.
<li><a href='http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1928446//'>Ron Howard's Best Movies</a><br />
Movies about race car drivers don't always have the easiest time with critics (see: <em>Days of Thunder</em>, <em>Stroker Ace</em>, <em>Six Pack</em>), but if there's a director in Hollywood capable of turning driving really fast in circles into a solid all-around blockbuster, it's probably <a href="/celebrity/ron_howard/">Ron Howard</a>. He gets his chance this weekend, as the already well-reviewed <em><a href="/m/rush_2013/">Rush</a></em> (currently playing in Europe and in limited U.S. release) expands nationwide with the fact-based tale of James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br√ºhl), 1970s racing stars whose rivalry proved memorably entertaining on as well as off the course. Of course, this isn't Howard's first trip around the track, so we decided to dedicate this week's list to a rundown of some of the brighter critical highlights from a career full of crowd-pleasers. Goodbye gray sky, hello blue -- it's time for Total Recall!

<li><a href='http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1928379//'>Jake Gyllenhaal's Best Movies</a><br />
In what promises to be the most nail-bitingly intense kidnapping drama since Ron Howard directed Mel Gibson in 1996's <em>Ransom</em>, <a href="/celebrity/jake_gyllenhaal/">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> and Hugh Jackman team up in this weekend's <em><a href="/m/prisoners_2013/">Prisoners</a></em> to find a pair of missing girls who may or may not have been lured into a van by gross Paul Dano. In honor of Gyllenhaal's latest dramatic tour de force, we've decided to devote this week's list to a fond look back at some of the brightest critical highlights from a wonderfully eclectic filmography that looks like it's only begun to tap into his prodigious potential. It's time for Total Recall!
