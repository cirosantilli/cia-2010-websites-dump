One was a web client for the Android Market with OTA installations -- you just browse to an app you want to install while on your desktop and choose to push it to your Android device -- and the other was a cloud-based music backup and streaming service. The latter has since picked up the moniker of Google Music in subsequent rumors, and today both are receiving some speculative support for a launch at tomorrow\'s Honeycomb event. Android and Me has an insider source claiming the web-based Android Market is finally ready to roll out, whereas BusinessWeek reports Andy Rubin is heading up Google\'s digital music team and also has software ready for release, potentially at some point this month.

document.write(' We\'re honestly surprised it took this long, but Google is finally employing a social hook that so many of its peers (Foursquare, Facebook, Yelp, and so on) have long embraced: the location-based check-in. Coming to Google Latitude with today\'s Maps 5.1 for Android, the company hopes to set itself apart from the competition with features like check-in notifications (disabled by default), automatic check-ins for your most frequent establishments (case-by-case activation), and \"check out\" that detects when you leave a location.   So what\'s the incentive to use the service? Not much at this point -- no badges, no sharing through third-party services like Twitter (Latitude-only at the moment), no support for simultaneous check-in with other services, no special vendor discounts (Google told us there\'s nothing to announce yet), and no ability to create a venue like your apartment (Places only). What it does right is a tiered system of special statuses based on check-in frequency -- you can become a regular, VIP, or Guru (Google says it\'s not definite yet on how many check-ins each status bump will require). iOS Latitude users will be able to see where their Android friends check in, but at this point the option to pimp your specific location is for Google\'s platform only. If you\'re a fan of Latitude already, this is probably a no-brainer, but for everyone else, don\'t expect mayoral coffee discounts just yet.

document.write(' It\'s been quite a while since Apple\'s tight reins on the App Store were a subject worth discussing, but they\'re back in the spotlight now following the company\'s rejection of Sony\'s Reader app for iOS. The reasons given to Sony were that Apple will not no longer accept applications that permit in-app purchases of content that don\'t go through Apple itself, and, moreover, will not tolerate apps that access material purchased through external content stores. So the Sony Reader Store is out -- but wait, doesn\'t the Kindle app spend its time serving up Kindlebooks? No comment has been offered on the matter from either Apple or Amazon, while Sony\'s Reader Store page describes the situation as \"an impasse\" and promises to seek \"other avenues to bring the Reader experience to Apple mobile devices.\" In the mean time, you can get the Reader app for Android or just read your ebooks on a device dedicated to that task.  Update: As noted by Harry McCracken over at Technologizer, it has actually been Apple\'s longstanding policy to forbid in-app purchases -- the Kindle and Nook apps send you to a browser -- so Sony\'s desire to do so will have been the major cause for the Reader application\'s rejection. That doesn\'t invalidate the second concern expressed in the New York Times article, that Apple will no longer tolerate content brought in from external stores, which is a displeasing development, if true.  Update 2: Looks like McCracken nailed it -- Apple\'s come out with a statement pointing out that the App Store guidelines require that apps that allow content purchases must also allow them in-app through Apple\'s official iTunes-backed system. We can\'t imagine that Sony is thrilled with the idea of cutting Apple in on Reader content, but if they want to play ball, they should be able to score an approval. Notably, Apple says that they are \"now requiring\" this even though the guidelines haven\'t changed, suggesting they\'re just now getting around to enforcing it; the effect on iOS\' Kindle and Nook apps isn\'t yet known, but we wouldn\'t be surprised if Apple started nudging them in the direction of pushing updates.

document.write(' You could say Bing is taking a cue from its competition, but it seems to be more literally taking search results as well. Google Fellow Amit Singhal is claiming so much and has provided some amusing (if not totally clever) results from its \"Bing Sting.\" Here\'s how it works: find a search term that returns no matches for either site, make a \"honeypot\" page manually appear for the term, then have about 20 Google employees make the search (and click the top link) using Internet Explorer with both Suggested Sites and the Bing Toolbar on. Within two weeks, Singhal claims, a handful (about 7 to 9) of the 100 or so \"honeypot\" results were popping up in Bing. Bizarre choices, too, like mbrzxpgjys, hiybbprqag, and indoswiftjobinproduction.   So, is this \"cheating,\" as Singhal specifically alleges? The experiment had to be run with Bing\'s toolbar and / or Suggested Search feature activated, which it explicitly says are used to collect data and improve services. And more popular search terms do return different results, It\'s not as if Microsoft is using non-public information, but is this an example of taking an unfair shortcut? That\'s a debate we imagine with rage for quite some time.  Update: Microsoft\'s been sending out the following statement from Stefan Weitz, director of Bing:  We use multiple signals and approaches in ranking search results. The overarching goal is to do a better job determining the intent of the search so we can provide the most relevant answer to a given query. Opt-in programs like the toolbar help us with clickstream data, one of many input signals we and other search engines use to help rank sites. That\'s pretty ambiguous, so ZDNet\'s Mary Jo Foley pressed for a followup and was flatly told \"We do not copy Google\'s results.\" We\'re sure there\'s going to be a lot more analysis and discussion to come -- this ought to be fun.Google accuses Bing of \'cheating,\' piggybacking off its search results (updated) originally appeared on Engadget on Tue, 01 Feb 2011 12:21:00 EDT.

document.write(' How do electric cars make you feel? We won\'t give you explicit details of just what sort of sensations standing next to the Audi e-tron Spyder at CES inspired in us, but let\'s just say they were very good ones. However, the CEO who stepped out of that very car, Rupert Stadler, is refusing to be swept in by all the EV excitement. The company is working on a battery-powered R8 supercar that will come toward the end of next year and plenty of other electric and hybrid models are in development, but Stadler is taking the slow road to adoption, saying:  We are still in the early phase with the electric vehicle, in terms of commercialization and whether the cars will be sold or leased, or will just be a collector\'s car... We should not overplay euphoria for electric vehicles. Overplaying euphoria is something that consumer electronics companies have evolved to an art form, whipping up a frenzy among fans, inspiring pre-release camp-outs on a regular basis. We haven\'t seen anyone camping at a car dealership since... ever. Maybe there\'s a lesson to be learned there.Audi CEO Ruper Stadler taking time with EVs, refuses to feel \'euphoria for electric vehicles\' originally appeared on Engadget on Tue, 01 Feb 2011 11:43:00 EDT.

Chipzilla is teaming up with Capgemini SA to create a \"tablet-style computer\" that lets humans control the power consumed by their appliances. Later, presumably when there are enough of these smart devices on the grid, it could allow utilities to more intelligently manage its electricity allocation. According to Intel\'s Joe Jensen, general manager for low-power embedded processors, \"energy is a big part of our project to extend the fringe of computing out to the next thing.\" Indeed, under Paul Otellini\'s lead, Intel is targeting fuel pumps at the corner gas station, advertising signs, and even exercise equipment as it seeks opportunities beyond traditional computing devices -- a market Intel believes to be worth about $10 billion. The goal of the Intel / Capgemini initiative is to offer a full-service smart-grid solution, according to Steven Harris, head of smart home services at Capgemini. Mind you, Intel\'s involvement shouldn\'t come as a total surprise here, seeing as how it was showing off wall panels for real-time utility management in the -- groan -- \"digital crib\" way back at CES in 2010.

document.write(' Intel raised quite a few eyebrows yesterday by disclosing that its Cougar Point chipsets suffer from an incurable design issue that would potentially degrade Serial ATA transfers over time. AnandTech has gone to the trouble of getting in touch with Intel to seek more information and the problem, as it turns out, is a single transistor that\'s prone to a higher current leakage than tolerable. This can not only diminish performance over the 3Gbps SATA ports, it can actually make them fail altogether. There is more comforting news, however, in that the pair of 6Gbps SATA ports on the chipset are untroubled by this ailment, so devices and users that never plug into the 3Gbps connections can just carry on as if nothing\'s ever happened. For everyone else, a repair and replacement service is taking place now, with Intel\'s budget for dealing with this problem said to be a generous $700 million.Intel Sandy Bridge chipset flaw identified as a rogue transistor affecting SATA ports originally appeared on Engadget on Tue, 01 Feb 2011 04:56:00 EDT.

According to the press release, the DSC-HX100V is the first of the Cyber-shot line to include a 27mm Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonar T lens with 30x optical zoom, while its smaller compact brother, the DSC-HX9V, is also the first to sport a 24mm Sony G lens with a 16x optical zoom. That\'s certainly great news for lurkers or folks who like shooting from a far, especially when considering both cameras are capable of recording 1920 x 1080 60p HD video. Their new \"Exmor R\" back-illuminated CMOS sensor also is the first to support a so-called Intelligent Sweep Panorama HR mode, which lets users capture up to 42.9 megapixel scenes with a whopping 10480 x 4096 resolution. Speaking of panoramas, the new camera\'s have also picked up the same 3D Sweep Panorama Mode, GPS, and Dual Recording functions found on other cyber shots announced back at CES. If you\'re dying to get your hands on that crazy zoom action, their official release is set for April with pre-sales starting in February. Price wise, the DSC-HX100V and DSC-HX9V cameras will cost about $450 and $350, respectively. For more details hit up the PR after the break or browse through the gallery below.

This marks the second time users have been asked to re-adjust their expectations for when the big red box might pop up on their favorite media manager, but to Boxee\'s credit, we were glad to see the company come right out with the situation instead of leaving us all on pins and needles.
