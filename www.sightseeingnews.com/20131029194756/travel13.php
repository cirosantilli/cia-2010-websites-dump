This post is brought to you by CT Business Travel. For more information on sponsored posts read here. As glamorous as going away on business sounds, the glamour element usually ends up way down the list if you’re a regular business traveller. The sad reality is most business travellers’ trips consist of spending most of their time in taxis, airports, planes, hotels and meeting rooms. If a business trip does allow a small window of opportunity to actually see the city being visited then it should be grabbed with both hands! Travelling to any city for the first time always takes some getting used to, especially if the trip is to a foreign country where a different language is spoken and is one you’re not familiar with. Usually business trips are coordinated so that the least amount of time is spent in the city being visited, time is money and therefore time is always of the essence. This is where smart phones are certainly a business traveller’s new best friend. Smart phone technology makes life so much easier and bearable when travelling away on business. Whilst there’s thousands of incredible games to choose from to help pass the time when travelling, this article uncovers some seriously good apps every business traveller should be downloading and using to make their trips as hassle free as possible. These recommendations have been compiled by CT Business Travel, one of the largest independent business travel agents in the UK, oh, and the best part is all these apps are FREE! App 1 &#8211; XE Currency (FREE to download) As the name suggests, this app is all about currency, providing on-the-go worldwide currency exchange rates including the all-important currency converter. This app is available on both the iphone and ipad, it offers the latest live currency rates but records each update which helps for those periods when you don’t have access to the internet. How good is this app – well it was app of the week on iTunes and has had over 5 million downloads with thousands of top customer ratings, so you can safely say it works and is good. App 2 &#8211; Award Wallet (FREE to download) Tired of logging in to keep track of the different loyalty schemes you participate in? Well look no further than ‘Award Wallet’, the app that allows you to load all the loyalty programmes you participate in into one easy to use application. For those people who travel regularly on business who no doubt have memberships with many different companies, whether that’s frequent flyer airline programmes, hotel, car rental schemes, as well as credit card points schemes, ‘Award Wallet’ automatically keeps track of your activity in each scheme you participate in. Get quick access to balances even if you don’t have internet connection as once logged in you can access data in an offline mode. App 3 – Skype (FREE to download) If you’re a fan of using Skype on your desktop then you’ll love having it on your smartphone too. Skype, if you’re not aware allows users to make and receive calls for free anywhere. You can obviously enjoy the free benefits this app provides even when you’re not travelling. But for business travellers on overseas trips, this is the perfect app for making calls back home to loved ones or friends without incurring the huge costs of using a traditional landline. App 4 &#8211; TripAdvisor Offline City Guides (FREE to download) The ratings the TripAdvisor city guide app have accrued speak for themselves, this TripAdvisor app features many of the world’s leading cities, so the chances are the city you want is already featured. All the restaurants, hotels and attractions featured in each city on tripadvisor.com are featured within this app, including the usual thousands of reviews. The app is extremely easy to use offering varying ways to search for the places you want to find, as well as a ‘point me there’ feature which uses the phone’s GPS and compass to guide you to the restaurant or attraction you wish to visit. The app also includes essential city facts as well as recommended self-guided tours to help you explore the destination, landmarks and find hidden gems handpicked by TripAdvisor members and destination experts. The app works offline too, so there’s no need for a live data connection to access the information on each city – which helps avoid those data roaming charges. App 5- Safeguard (FREE to download) Safeguard has been created to provide users with peace of mind concerning their safety and visibility. The app has been specifically tailored towards lone workers, VIPs and travellers who require assistance and locating in the event of an emergency. Ideal for business travellers visiting cities or countries that are not very safe. App 6 – Global Traveler (FREE to download) Global Traveler is a monthly magazine primarily focused on those who regularly travel on business, with a heavy bias to luxury! The magazine produces unbiased independent reviews keeping users up to speed on latest news from the airline and hotel industry, as well as destinations themselves. The publication also includes features on the finest food and wines to be experienced within a city, as well as golf courses, spas and other luxury indulgences one might require when travelling on business. This is all in addition to the regular articles written on crucial ‘need to know’ information, such as travel health, technology and news.
<li><a href='http://feeds.bootsnall.com/~r/bna/businesstravellogue/~3/_4kruu1lwC0/work-and-travel-making-the-leap.html'>Work and Travel – Making the Leap</a><br />
Travel lovers around the world have dreamed about combining their love of travel with work, but how does one make the leap from cubicle dweller to a job involving travel? With the increasing availability of internet in even the most remote of places (you can get online in the middle of hiking the Inca Trail in the Andes), it&#8217;s becoming easier and easier to combine work and travel. There are many opportunities for finding work on the road, and if you have ever thought about trying to make that leap, consider the following options: Teaching English either as and ESL teacher (if you only have a college degree) or as an international school teacher (if you are a certified teacher in your home country) Work in a service based industry like restaurants, bars, hotels, or cruises. Tour Guide Flight Attendant Pilot Travel Nurse Au Pair Peace Corps NGO Worker In addition to the above suggestions, more and more people are making the move to a location independent lifestyle, where all you need is a computer and an internet connection. More and more companies are allowing their employees to work from home, and if you&#8217;re allowed to work from home, making the leap to working from anywhere in the world isn&#8217;t too great. There are certain jobs that are better for this than others, but the key is selling it to your employer if this isn&#8217;t the norm in your company. Star by working from home a few days a week, and make sure that you go above and beyond. You need to make it worthwhile for the company, so point out all the benefits of having you work remotely, first from home, and eventually from another country. Companies can save on things like health insurance, parking passes, offices, lunches, and all the other costs that businesses incur by having their employees in an office setting. Making the ordeal worthwhile to your boss is key to making this happen. Photo credit: 1

With the holidays fast approaching it’s time to start looking for gifts. And we all know how hard it can be to find the perfect gift for a business person, whether they are your office friend or your spouse. To help you find the gifts easier, we’ve included bunch of items in each of the following categories. Electronics Music & Books Gift Baskets Jewelry Travel Items Business gifts Moreover, each category is diving into “budget”, “medium” and “luxury” items, based on their price, so you can easily browse according to the allocated budget. Plus, plenty of the items are currently on sale so it’s worth it to at least take a look and maybe even stock up for the upcoming festive days. Electronics You can never go wrong with electronics. Everyone loves the gadgets and chances are your gift recipient has been on a lookout for a certain thing for a while. Their best assets are the practicality and portability. Budget Mini High Precision USB Mouse Anyone who ever used a laptop knows that in some cases the mouse is a critical accessory. This small and compact high precision USB mouse can be used with any laptop and can be stashed away in any laptop case or backpack. Hands-Free Earbud with In-Line Microphone Using a hands-free when talking on your cell is very comfortable and elegant; I never leave home without mine especially when I go in crowded places or when I travel. Mini Bluetooth Headsets Hands Free Since the majority of cells nowadays have Bluetooth so it makes sense to use a Mini Bluetooth Headsets Hands free. It works with Sony Ericsson, Nokia, Motorola, Samsung and other cells on the market. You can use it within 32 ft range. Middle-Range Instant Cell Phone Charger It seems that we are surgically attached to our cell phones nowadays and when the battery dies on us, we are downright depressed. Help others avoid the depression with this Instant Cell Phone Charger , which gives 30 min talk time (and 15 hours stand-by time). It’s easily powered with AA batteries. Energizer Energi To Go Instant Cell Phone Charger If the model above doesn’t please you, there’s another option: Energizer Energi To Go Instant Cell Phone Charger which works with cells charge via mini-USB port (including Blackberry) and works even when the cell’s battery is drained. Kingston DataTraveler USB flash drive Backing up on a flash drive might not be the wisest option but you should always keep such an item with you (I’ve got one on my key chain). You never know when you need to move files between computers or maybe want to take some photos to be printed. The Kingston DataTraveler USB flash drive works great with any laptop (or desktop). Noise Canceling Earphones Nothing is more annoying than hearing the background noise when we listen to music or an audio book. So it’s time for the Noise Canceling Earphones which offer not only noise control but also really good quality sound. Digital Photo Keychain The easiest way to keep your memories with you is with a Digital Photo Keychain. It is quite a universal gift and practical too.

It’s a great gift for any active corporate employee or someone who likes to travel. Logitech QuickCam Pro for Notebooks Video conferences have become the norm in many companies so a web cam is useful. Plus, you can also keep in touch with the family while on the road. Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard If someone is used to a full keyboard, typing from the blackberry or a PDA is downright torture (add in some long finger nails, ladies, and you’ve got a nightmare!). But everything can be solved with this Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard. The stand supports most phones and works via Bluetooth. It’s light and you don’t need a PC to download the drivers (it takes them directly from the phone). Kodak EasyShare Digital Picture Frame We all love the picture frames on the desks.

This Compact Wireless-G USB Adapter just needs to be plugged and it allows you to connect to the Internet. Luxury The iPod has become a fashion statement and a great way to store music, photos and videos. While traveling, it’s excellent to keep you from getting bored.

<li><a href='http://feeds.bootsnall.com/~r/bna/businesstravellogue/~3/tuKMuwY3W6c/bothered-about-doing-business-in-germany.html'>Bothered about doing business in Germany?</a><br />
Clinching a business deal can be nerve-wracking at the best of times &#8211; but when doing so in a foreign country it can seem like an unnecessary nightmare. That&#8217;s because every country has its own unique methods of conducting business. In addition, you&#8217;ve to negotiate the transport system, hope you&#8217;ve been booked into a decent hotel, and can actually converse with people. So before you start hyperventilating, we&#8217;ve jotted down a few helpful pointers for doing business in Germany: Business Etiquette Meetings can be formal and to the point initially. In fact, unlike in France, don&#8217;t expect a lot of small talk at all. You&#8217;ll also find your German colleague values truth over diplomacy, which can seem abrupt and almost rude at first but it&#8217;s more straight-forward, efficient and in the long run you&#8217;ll really come to appreciate it. Germans make a big distinction between work and family life and rarely shall the twain meet. You should feel very honoured to be invited home for dinner with a German colleague&#8217;s family. Don&#8217;t be surprised to find fewer women in senior management positions in Germany than in other European countries. The situation is changing but perhaps not as quickly in other places you&#8217;re used to. German business talk tends to be very structured and often meetings are accompanied by an agenda received several days in advance. This is for the purpose of clarity and speed and actually makes a lot of sense but it&#8217;s the kind of thing Germany gets its &#8216;efficiency&#8217; reputation from. Business decisions can often take time too while senior management inspect every detail (never expect an impulsive business decision in Germany). Punctuality is important when doing business in Germany. It is customary to arrive ten minutes prior to a meeting as being late is regarded as rude as well as unprofessional. As a result of this and their hard-working industrial nature, you will rarely find a German businessman or woman having to work overtime or come in to office especially early in the morning. Accommodation When doing business in Germany you&#8217;ll want a hotel where you can have facilities such as wi-fi, a scanner, fax machine etc at your fingertips. Hotels such as the Holiday Inn can provide these as well as a formal conference room (konferenzräume) in Frankfurt if conducting business out-of-hours or, for confidentially purposes, outside the office. They&#8217;ll also have parking provision for lease cars and tend to be cited near the city centre or near good public transport options. Getting Around Germany&#8217;s national train service &#8211; Deutsche Bahn AG &#8211; is high-speed, super-efficient and links to every major city in the country. Travelling at 190 mph it can also be costly but it&#8217;s an impressive service. Driving between cities is also easy thanks to the Autobahn where there is NO speed limit (which can be rather nerve-wracking at first). Rental cars are simple to find and in abundance. Internal flights will also take you to every city in Germany and most within the space of an hour. Many airports such as Munich, Berlin, Kohn and Hamburg offer major international flights. Frankfurt is Europe&#8217;s second largest airport in terms of passenger volume. Language In Germany all nouns have capital letters which may seem strange at first but you soon get used to it. In terms of pronunciation the letters &#8216;ch&#8217; are said with the tongue behind the teeth. Germans can come across as blunt and even rude. But 99 per cent of the time it&#8217;s not intentional. Particularly in business, German&#8217;s appreciate clarity and economy. As such they will drop any unnecessary words such as &#8216;maybe&#8217; or &#8216;sort of&#8217; &#8211; the type of words other European countries and Americans might consider conversational. Germans, even at leisure, are a nation of great &#8216;truth tellers&#8217; which, in turn, means diplomacy isn&#8217;t a strong point. But at least you&#8217;ll know exactly where you stand! Interesting business facts about Germany: In 2010 Germany had a population of 82.3 million &#8211; around 8.8 per cent of whom were not German born In religious terms both Protestant and Roman Catholic religions are dominant (roughly 33 per cent each with Muslim the next most popular religion at four per cent) Berlin is the largest city in Germany with a population of 3,431,675 recorded in 2008. Hamburg was second biggest with 1,772,100 and Munich third at 1,326,807 Last year Germany&#8217;s exports were valued at $1.337 trillion. Only China exported more goods (cars, metals, food) So there you have it. Some help in negotiating your way while working in Germany. Now go clinch that deal! photos by bollin, mattbuck4950

This is part of a new series here at WhyGo Business Travel featuring brief interviews with people who travel for work, asking them about what they do and some of their favorite travel tips. This way, if you&#8217;re looking for a career that will require travel, you&#8217;ll get to read about people doing some of the jobs you might consider &#8211; and you&#8217;ll also learn a few great travel tips from the travel pros! This week, we&#8217;re talking with Spud Hilton, who works for the San Francisco Chronicle and SFGate.com. He is, not surprisingly, based in San Francisco. He has his own travel blog on SFGate.com called Bad Latitude, and regularly posts on Twitter and Facebook as well as on his Bad Latitute TV channel on YouTube. What do you do? I&#8217;m the Travel Editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, so I oversee the writing, editing and production of the weekly Sunday Travel section, including writing or buying the original stories. I also write the Bad Latitude travel blog at SFGate.com and maintain the social media presence for the department, the blog and myself. What kind of travel do you get to do for work? Do you get to choose where you go? Oddly, my work travel tries to simulate vacation travel, both in the planning and execution, because I&#8217;m trying to travel the way readers do, although I tend to seek out places you&#8217;re not as likely to have heard of. I pick my own destinations, based mostly on which areas have been overlooked, on what we&#8217;ve done in the past and on where there are great stories. Do you add any extra &#8220;fun&#8221; days on to work trips? Why or why not? I always try to factor in a little down time, although it&#8217;s difficult to switch off the instinct to observe, gather information and write, so I rarely relax. The job itself, however, is what most folks would consider &#8220;fun,&#8221; so I can&#8217;t complain. What are your favorite and least favorite airports in which to spend extended periods (long layovers, flight delays, etc.)? My favorite is Dallas-Fort Worth, because I&#8217;m always passing through and there&#8217;s an excellent tequila and tacos bar with which I&#8217;m intimately familiar. My least favorite is Hell-AX (LAX), where the trials of the outrageously idiotic design are compounded by a lack of miracle technology that hasn&#8217;t made it to L.A. yet &#8212; A TRAM SYSTEM. Also, it would take years of brain-washing to get most of the current workers to even pretend they give a crap. How often do you get to travel for work? About 12-13 weeks a year, depending on my budget and the need for stories from specific regions. Did you choose your job at least in part because you love to travel? Would you make the same job choice again, knowing what you know now? Frankly, I didn&#8217;t know anything about travel until I got into the Travel Section as a copy editor and page designer. It seemed like a good gig, although I had lobbied to get into the section after reading a few articles that had the power to inform, entertain and transport me, and thought &#8220;That&#8217;s the kind of writing I want to do.&#8221; It was the right choice; I&#8217;d do it again. What are some of your favorite travel tips that you&#8217;ve picked up? Take a picture of your passport and keep it on your smart phone; you can use one 5V charger to power almost any USB 2 gadget; and don&#8217;t forget that you have camping knife in the secret pocket of your travel pants while going through airport security in Berlin. What one travel tip would you, as a business traveler, pass along to someone who doesn&#8217;t travel as often? Air turbulence often feels the same as being in a beat-up school bus on a really bad road. Every time the plane lurches, picture the wheels hitting another pothole. (I don&#8217;t have a fear of flying, but I seem to sit next to plenty of people who do.) What advice do you have for someone who&#8217;s interested in doing what you do? Marry someone rich. Seriously. Travel writing almost never pays enough to live on, and newspaper travel editors are on the endangered species list (down to just 13 full-timers in the U.S.). So get a sugar mama or sugar daddy. Find out more about Spud by checking out his blog Bad Latitude at SFGate.com, and you can also follow him on Twitter @SpudHilton. >> Learn more about travel jobs

This is part of a new series here at WhyGo Business Travel featuring brief interviews with people who travel for work, asking them about what they do and some of their favorite travel tips. This way, if you&#8217;re looking for a career that will require travel, you&#8217;ll get to read about people doing some of the jobs you might consider &#8211; and you&#8217;ll also learn a few great travel tips from the travel pros! This week, we&#8217;re talking with Jeanette Anderson. Jeanette is a Kansas City-based consultant who travels extensively for work and enjoys traveling so much she does it in her free time, too. What do you do? I am a consultant for Cerner Corporation. I travel in the US implementing computer systems for hospitals and physician practices. Mostly the Mid-west and Great Lakes and have spent most of my time for the past few years traveling to Indiana. What kind of travel do you get to do for work? Do you get to choose where you go? I travel almost every week, flying to the client site on Monday and then back on Thursday afternoon. Since my projects are generally a year or more long, I go to the same client each week for that year. I have had some projects where I have alternated projects and project weeks. Do you add any extra &#8220;fun&#8221; days on to work trips? Why or why not? Definitely have added extra fun days to trips and had people come visit Indianapolis. I have friends who have come to see Colts games, do museum tours and got tickets at the last minute for the NCAA men’s basketball finals in 2010. Looking forward to making a point to go see the Kentucky Derby and the Indianapolis 500 in 2012. What are your favorite and least favorite airports in which to spend extended periods (long layovers, flight delays, etc.)? Kansas City International (MCI) is my home airport and my favorite. You really can’t beat the convenience as a local to arrive 1 hour before and go straight across the road to parking. Detroit is really my favorite airport to connect in. Memphis is my least favorite for pure aesthetics. O’Hare always seemed to be delayed, but it was amusing on Monday mornings that I could fly in, drive to client site and be there before the Chicago locals. How often do you get to travel for work? Usually every week for the past 9 years. I usually have a week working from the corporate HQ about once every 8 weeks. Did you choose your job at least in part because you love to travel? Would you make the same job choice again, knowing what you know now? I chose my job because the consulting market dried up after 9/11 &#8211; my first 10 months, I didn’t travel very much, but have been on the road ever since. As a consultant, you really don’t have much of a routine and really have a lot of flexibility depending on the company. You get to see new places and new things all the time, so it isn’t for someone who needs a set routine or who doesn’t expect to learn something new and meet all new people every year. I have honestly enjoyed it and being able to just work anywhere from a folding table in a trailer to a plush office, to a little cubby in the corner of an airport or even a SkyClub. What are some of your favorite travel tips that you&#8217;ve picked up? If you are a young female, you may want to “pick up” a fake wedding ring. There are sometimes those guys on the plane that just don’t know the meaning of &#8220;I just want to sit here and read and not sit and hear about how cool you are.&#8221; If there is ever a re-book situation or cancellation, always call the airline, especially in the smaller airports. The agents at these local airports aren’t as fast and are working on the 20 people who are crowded in line in front of you. Delays happen, so be pleasant to airline employees &#8211; they really can’t control the weather and aren’t the plane mechanics or FAA inspectors. Try to stick with one airline or hotel chain and figure out how to make that work with your corporate policy. When they see your face and know you there should be some nice perks coming your way &#8211; and let the hotel managers know. Having rooms filled with happy customers is what they want. Also, hotels and airlines will often be able to match status. For example, if you have status then the new client has a different hotel chain, you can often get them to match status if you can prove or talk to them about how you will be loyal. What one travel tip would you, as a business traveler, pass along to someone who doesn&#8217;t travel as often? Get the right sized carry-on. Stop overpacking and trying to fit the 22 inch suitcase packed to bursting in the overhead bin. Get a 19-inch International one. You don’t need a new pair of pants or shoes every day. What advice do you have for someone who&#8217;s interested in doing what you do? If you think you will be doing this for a while (3 yrs or more) just buy the expensive Tumi suitcase. I went through 3 $100 suitcases before I just bought the Tumi on sale for $450 that I then traveled with for 7 years. Everyone will hate travel at around the 3 year mark, do what you can to get a travel break around that time, so that you can get annoyed with having a daily commute, sitting in a cube from 9-5, etc. If you do that, it seems like you can continue to travel and get less annoyed with the inevitable delays every time you get stuck in traffic.

This is part of a new series here at WhyGo Business Travel featuring brief interviews with people who travel for work, asking them about what they do and some of their favorite travel tips. This way, if you&#8217;re looking for a career that will require travel, you&#8217;ll get to read about people doing some of the jobs you might consider &#8211; and you&#8217;ll also learn a few great travel tips from the travel pros! This week, we&#8217;re talking with Sharon Miro, who&#8217;s been in the print and multi-media publishing field for more than 35 years. What do you do? For the last 12 years I was the Senior Vice President, National Sales Director for Fox Associates, a publisher’s rep firm based in Chicago. I directed a nationally based sales force located in 5 offices, and “handled” high-level clients and publishers. Because of my extensive background in both production &#038; editorial, I was perfectly positioned to help publishers find the right mix to enhance sales of all assets. Although I started in print, I embraced the new technology and became somewhat specialized in helping print publishers transition to electronic media. I am now “semiretired,” handling select accounts and doing some consulting for select publishers. What kind of travel do you get to do for work? Do you get to choose where you go? The job I most recently held meant not only planned trips to each of the 5 offices but publisher and client meetings as well. Some of those were not so planned, and needed some last minute travel to put out a fire. Did I get to choose where I went? Not often enough! Do you add any extra &#8220;fun&#8221; days on to work trips? Why or why not? YES! I often tagged a few days on top of trips to New York, DC or New Orleans for mini-vacation. I reported directly to the President &#038; Owner and she was all for that, why not? She was more than aware of the long hours and hard work that business travel is, and was OK with adding on days. How often do you get to travel for work? I traveled as much as two weeks out of the month &#8211; sometimes hitting 3 cities during a trip. Or I would stay for 2-3 weeks in a corporate apartment in Chicago or New York, and train to DC, Philadelphia or Boston for day trips. Did you choose your job at least in part because you love to travel? Would you make the same job choice again, knowing what you know now? No, I did not choose my job because of the travel. Would I make the same job choice again? Maybe. Most people think any kind of travel is glamorous &#8211; it’s not. On most trips I only saw the inside of a convention center or hotel. Red eye flights and 14 hour days in 3” heels are not fun or glamorous. What are some of your favorite travel tips that you&#8217;ve picked up? Pack as light as possible. Invest in zip lock bags &#8211; they save a lot of space. Try to find some of the 2.5-gallon size &#8211; perfect for sweaters to cold weather places. If you are lucky enough to have a base in one or two towns, as I was, leave items you use over and over there &#8211; buy a second set of hot rollers! Wear comfortable but NOT sloppy clothes on a plane. Know where you have to/want to be the first 6 hours after you land anywhere. Have a plan for that, and the rest will work out. What one travel tip would you, as a business traveler, pass along to someone who doesn&#8217;t travel as often? DO NOT be impatient. You will get there eventually and the Coliseum will still be there. Get out of the comfort zone and experience as much local flavor as possible. If you are traveling for business and are tagging some days on top of that, ask your social networks where to eat or what to see. Don’t try to pack too much into anyone trip: remember it’s a vacation not a death march! What advice do you have for someone who&#8217;s interested in doing what you do? That’s a longer story than anyone has time to read! But let it suffice that any kind of sales is hard work that demands an adventurous spirit, and a good sense of humor. Sorta the same thing you find in world travelers.

This is part of a new series here at WhyGo Business Travel featuring brief interviews with people who travel for work, asking them about what they do and some of their favorite travel tips. This way, if you&#8217;re looking for a career that will require travel, you&#8217;ll get to read about people doing some of the jobs you might consider &#8211; and you&#8217;ll also learn a few great travel tips from the travel pros! This week, we&#8217;re talking with Nanette Reid, an architectural and interior photographer. Nanette is Australian and is currently based in Bangkok. What do you do? I&#8217;m an architectural and interior photographer. We work with architects, designers, hotels, resorts, magazines etc producing imagery to match each individual&#8217;s specific requirements. What kind of travel do you get to do for work? Do you get to choose where you go? Currently, I travel a great deal throughout Asia/SE Asia, and previously it has been worldwide &#8211; Asia, Australasia, UK, USA, Europe, China, Japan. Do you add any extra &#8220;fun&#8221; days on to work trips? Why or why not? On the odd occasion I have been able to add some of these into work trips, but only if the flights coincide with this. Usually, it&#8217;s on the next plane out to shoot at the next location. But building this in does help you recharge the batteries after many days of shooting, often 18hr days, and a day off is well earned. How often do you get to travel for work? 2 out of 3 shoots are travel related. Did you choose your job at least in part because you love to travel? Would you make the same job choice again, knowing what you know now? Not at all. The travel component is an added bonus! If I had known when I had started out that travel would be such an integral part of our assignments, I&#8217;d have still chosen this career! What are some of your favorite travel tips that you&#8217;ve picked up? Pack light &#8211; solid colours are always a good choice and one good jacket. You can dress up a pair of jeans with a jacket, and wear them on assignment as well. Always have a stocked wet pack in the suitcase &#8211; you never know when you need to travel and hunting for this at the very last minute is painful. I restock it when I get back &#8211; if that toothpaste tube is 3/4 empty, it gets replaced! Do some research about the place you&#8217;re visiting &#8211; even if you don&#8217;t get the chance to venture out, knowing details about the country/city/area you are visiting always impresses the client, and gives you something to break the ice with others you are introduced to. What one travel tip would you, as a business traveler, pass along to someone who doesn&#8217;t travel as often? Carry-on &#8211; pack a change of underwear and a clean shirt, along with a toothbrush &#038; toothpaste! I got caught in the Heathrow 2007 security breach and our luggage (from Dublin) was not unloaded. Having to fly to Cairo the following day without any equipment or personal items was not a pleasant experience. It was 5 days before I actually had my luggage returned, however a colleague waited 2 months! Luckily another colleague had to source wardrobe for the shoot, and he made the time to purchase us all underwear; the hotel we were shooting allowed for us to have rush laundry every night, however if we&#8217;d been shooting elsewhere, it would have required us to shop the day after we arrived. What advice do you have for someone who&#8217;s interested in doing what you do? Be prepared for an awful lot of hard yards. If you don&#8217;t have a thick skin or tenacity to hang in there, being a self employed photographer is probably not an ideal career for you. It takes time to build relationships with clients and get your foot in the door to have a shot at estimating for an assignment. Plus you need to be a &#8220;jack-of-all-trades&#8221;: marketing, invoicing, estimating, travel agent, producer, general problem solver etc &#8211; all of these are part of the job. I shoot maybe 30% of the time; the other 70% is spent following leads, attending meetings, general paperwork, accounts etc. But it&#8217;s well worth the hard slog, when you get to see the Pyramids and sail on the Nile, whilst enjoying the sunset, for an assignment with a 5-star hotel group.

This way, if you&#8217;re looking for a career that will require travel, you&#8217;ll get to read about people doing some of the jobs you might consider &#8211; and you&#8217;ll also learn a few great travel tips from the travel pros! Fly fishing in Colorado This week, we&#8217;re talking with Cliff Rogers. Cliff is a Brisbane-based sales manager with Ivolve, an Australian technology company that serves the mining industry. What do you do? Our business provides mining and resource companies with real-time fleet management, production, maintenance and safety systems. I’m responsible for Sales &#038; Marketing and apart from business development, I work with client businesses at all levels to ensure that our solutions match their requirements. What kind of travel do you get to do for work? Do you get to choose where you go? I travel regularly within Australia, with some travel also to Indonesia; the Brisbane, QLD – Perth, WA flight is the longest non-stop domestic sector anywhere in the world, generally 5 hours there and 4 hours back (due mostly to the prevailing Westerly head/tail winds). Typically my travel is driven by client requirements. Mining in Australia is conducted mainly in central and northern Queensland, the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, and northern and southern Western Australia, so this is where I spend most of my time. Do you add any extra &#8220;fun&#8221; days on to work trips? Why or why not? Mostly it’s business only when I travel – fly in, get business done, fly out. This is mainly because of family commitments back home in Queensland, and because when you’ve travelled as much and for as many years as I have, eventually you get to the point where you’ve seen most everything there is to see if you’re going to the same places. How often do you get to travel for work? I spend between a third and a half of my time travelling for work. Did you choose your job at least in part because you love to travel? Would you make the same job choice again, knowing what you know now? No, and yes! I chose the job because I love working with people, and being presented with the opportunity to problem-solve on a whole-of-enterprise level. I’d definitely make the same choice again; it’s a great business, and I enjoy the travel. What are some of your favorite travel tips that you&#8217;ve picked up? Travel light! Several advantages here – if you take carry-on luggage only the airlines can’t lose your bags, and there’s no waiting at the luggage carousel at the other end. Get on-board with airline and hotel loyalty programs; you’ll generally be better looked after, and if you structure them right you can enjoy some or all of the benefits for private use! What one travel tip would you, as a business traveler, pass along to someone who doesn&#8217;t travel as often? Think about personal security before you travel: where are you going to carry passports, tickets, cash, credit cards, travellers cheques, etc? How are you going to keep these critical documents safe during your trip? Good advice for guys in particular is to keep your wallet in your front pocket, not the back – much harder for pickpockets to steal. What advice do you have for someone who&#8217;s interested in doing what you do? Think value rather than price, think client rather than product, and think communication rather than promotion. Oh, and enjoy being challenged! Find out more about Cliff by checking out his website ivolve.com. >> Learn more about travel jobs
