Cycling in Europe Cycling has always been a popular mode of transport for Europeans. This has been the case for a long time and bikingâ€™s popularity is not only in large towns and cities but also in rural villages and the countryside. Whatever city or country you travel to within Europe a bike rental company will not be far away. I work in the hospitality industry in Ireland for the Drury Court Hotel Group and we have noticed in recent years the increasing demand from our guests for bike rentals. People are becoming more active in general and this has begun to cross over into the holiday industry too. In my opinion, the best way to get around and to see any new destination is on a bike. This is not possible for all people to do for a number of different reasons but is worth doing if you are able to and if you have never previously considered it. Cycling in Cities City Breaks often entail lots and lots of walking, but if you are like me you will prefer to get up on a bike and see the city this way. It is a quicker way to get around and can be cheaper also because you can avoid using public transport and taxis. The majority of big European cities have become more bike friendly in recent years with the introduction of more cycle lanes, and bicycle parking facilities. Many cities today also have city biking initiatives which provide free or low cost bikes which are available at various bike stations around the city. The cities that offer such a service include Barcelona, Dublin, Paris, Copenhagen, Vienna, London and Paris. If the city you are travelling to does not offer such a programme you will be sure to find a bike rental company within the city. Most bike rental companies will offer a very affordable hourly or day rate for rentals as well as offering bike tours which can be a really interesting way to see any city. Cycling in the Countryside If you are travelling to the European Countryside, in France or Ireland for example, you are probably going to be near a small town or village, this is a good a place to start your bike rides from. If you have not brought your own bike with you, many of these types of locations will have a bike rental service nearby that will organise pick-ups and transportation of bicycles etc. for you. This is a very good way of seeing the area from a different perspective as well as getting to cycle places which are not accessible by car or tour bus, such as along the banks of a river or through a forest trail. One bit of advice I would offer to you is that if you are planning on going on rural cycles you need to be somewhat prepared. For example, dress appropriately for the weather, carry plenty of water and some snacks, carry a cell phone in case of an emergency and have a quantity of money on you because sometimes you just donâ€™t know where you might end up. There is plenty of good information about cycling abroad and biking holidays to be found online so be sure to do your research before you set off.
<li><a href='http://activetraveltours.com/active_travel_tours/how-to-choose-a-rock-climbing-harness'>How to Choose a Rock Climbing Harness</a><br />
The rock climbing harness is very vital because it connects the climber with his rope. Buying a harness is much more than walking into an adventure equipment store and picking up any top-quality harness. Here are some of the factors that must be considered: Different Types of Harnesses Crag or all-round harnesses are recommended for beginners as they function efficiently in different climbing applications such as gym climbing and top roping. These harnesses are equipped with padded leg loops and waist belts and are therefore very comfortable. Detachable leg loops on these harnesses allow climbers to answer the call of nature without untying themselves from the climbing rope. They are also equipped with a front loop that can be used to attach a rappel device. Alpine harnesses are constructed for mountain climbing. These have to be very light in weight and bulk, and therefore are equipped with nominal padding. They are made using non-absorbent material to ensure that the harnesses can stand mountain or glacier weather conditions. Their waist belt is very adjustable and their detachable leg loops allow climbers to change clothes or answer natureâ€™s call with the rope tied to their waist. Big wall climbing requires special harnesses that can withstand multiple-pitch and multiple-day climbing. Such harnesses are well-padded around the waistbelt and leg loops to make hanging more comfortable. They also feature gear racking to make the shoulder gear sling seem lighter. A strong haul loop at their back allows climbers to easily tow ropes or heavy bags. Climbers who participate in competitions like Speed Events can choose harnesses designed for competitive events. Such harnesses are slim and their webbing allows climbers to move freely. Padding and frills are limited. Factors To Be Considered Before Buying A Climbing Harness After determining the type of harness that will work for you, here are some factors you should consider before making a purchase: The fit characteristics of harnesses for women and children are different from those for men. Harnesses come in different styles â€“ the Diaper harness is made using flat webbing and a buckled waistbelt with adjustable leg loops, which allow climbers to wear it over different types of clothing; full-body harnesses are meant for children or adults with narrow waists; chest harnesses are worn on climbs in which the climber is at risk of falling on his head. If the harness fits tight, it will restrict the climberâ€™s movement or pinch him; if it is loose, it could let go all of a sudden and cause the climber to fall. The waistbelt should fit comfortably just above the hip bone. It should not restrict the breathing. Climbers should be able to double-back their leg loopâ€™s webbing straps through the buckles and still have 2 inches of strap left. The harness must be tied strictly as per the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. A harness lasts up to two years depending on usage. It should be immediately replaced if the climber feels it has weakened. These tips should help you choose an appropriate harness for when rock climbing.

Riding the bike trails of Costa Rica&#8230; &#8230;is an experience like no other. The popularity of the bike tour in Costa Rica has risen dramatically over the last decade or so. Itâ€™s now common to see groups and solo cyclists barrelling down the dirt trails and camping on the beaches in the twilight. If youâ€™re planning on visiting Mal Pais, Montezuma, and San Teresa on two wheels, remember these five items. bike the jungle 1.Â Â Â Â  Bike Shorts Â For obvious reasons, youâ€™re going to want to wear as little clothing as you possibly can. Itâ€™s important to wear a proper pair of bike shorts, though. For all of Costa Ricaâ€™s untouched beauty, itâ€™s still bumpy and rugged. It will take its toll on your backside. You donâ€™t want to fear having to sit down at the end of a ride because of searing pain.Â Bike shorts have lots of padding in the back so you can sit in the saddle for hours without feeling a thing. 2.Â Â Â Â  Large Water Bottle A common mistake of the novice cyclist is not bringing a big enough water bottle. The mountain and highland areas arenâ€™t particularly hot. You can get away with not bringing much. In the Pacific coastal areas, the temperatures are searing. If youâ€™re riding for eight hours each day youâ€™re going to get dehydrated quickly. Bring the largest bottle your bike can accommodate. Itâ€™s also worth bringing a backpack with a few emergency bottles of water. Never underestimate the Latin American heat. 3.Â Â Â Â  Long-Sleeve Shirt Â It might seem silly to wear clothing which actually covers the skin, but itâ€™s helpful. Youâ€™ll need to wear suncream to stop UV rays and sunburn. As you sweat, your body washes the cream away from your skin and leaves you exposed. By wearing a breathable cycling shirt, it washes away at a slower pace and leaves you more time to enjoy your bike tour in Costa Rica. 4.Â Â Â Â  Lightweight Layering Â Costa Rica is a very small country, especially if youâ€™re travelling across its width. You can find yourself in the middle of a steamy jungle before lunch and on a misty mountain plateau by dinner. It creates a challenge for cyclists. What should you wear to cope with the temperatures? The answer is in lightweight layers. These clothes keep you warm, or cool, whilst not being bulky. You can add and remove clothing as and when you need to. 1.Â Â Â Â  Energy Bars Guided cycling tours will take you to little restaurants and outposts where you can eat and replenish energy. If youâ€™re alone, or if you get separated from the main group, you can find yourself getting hungry fast. Stay energised by bringing along some foods which are high in energy foods. Consider dedicated energy bars and drinks, if theyâ€™re available. Energy gels are a favourite of cyclists as they donâ€™t change in consistency in the heat. If not, bananas are good for some quick energy. Alternatively, stop and have lunch. You donâ€™t want to tire yourself out by continuing to cycle on against your hunger pangs. The best way to combat hunger, though, is to eat properly before beginning your dayâ€™s ride.

<li><a href='http://activetraveltours.com/active_travel_tours/is-chartering-a-jet-right-for-your-active-travel-plans'>Is Chartering a Jet Right for Your Active Travel Plans?</a><br />
How to Look for the Best Jet Charter Company that Fits Your Needs Leaving On a Jet Plane Flying commercial for some individuals and companies is no longer convenient and comfortable. These companies believe that flying on private jet charters is the ultimate travel option. There are no more long lines, no more arriving at the airport three hours before the flight and no more unexpected passengers to sit beside. With a private airline, passengers can follow their own schedule and can choose the other passengers they ride with. But with the many private airline companies that have sprouted over the years, how will one know which one to choose? How can one look for the best private charter operator that matches their needs? Here are seven factors to consider in choosing the right jet charter service: 1. Company reputation The first thing you need to check when looking for jet charters is their reputation. Can this company be trusted? Are they known to provide great customer service? Checking the companyâ€™s website is not enough to know about their reputation. Further research online is needed. Getting feedback from family, friends or co-workers whoâ€™s hired that charter company is also a good idea. 2. Safety Safety is of prime importance in any travel. In looking for the best charter company, itâ€™s important to check its safety history. Does the charter airline have an excellent safety record or does their safety history have some negative entries? Every client should make sure they put their safety as a priority and choose only a charter airline that can provide the utmost safety in their flights. 3. Pilot Be sure to check the pilot hours of the aircraftâ€™s pilot. Different jet charter companies have different required pilot hours. In Australia though, a pilot can only fly commercial airlines if he has at least 200 pilot hours. Check if the pilots operating and providing FIFO aircraft services from that charter airline meet the minimum required pilot hours. Also check how many pilots would take charge of the travel. Some charter airlines may charge an additional fee for a second pilot. 4. Destination and trip length Private charter airlines can land in more airports compared to commercial airlines. Despite this, itâ€™s still important to check if the particular destination you need to land in has airports that can accommodate the charter airline hired. Upon providing the destination of choice also find out what the trip length would be. This way you can assess if a charter airline can provide the right aircraft that can bring the passengers in the target arrival time and date. 5. Facilities and services One of the perks of flying a private jet is the facilities and services one gets with the flight. Some charter airlines offer a butler, a kitchen, private bathroom, and hotel-like accommodation. If this is something needed for the flight, make sure the charter airline booked has these facilities. Also look into the additional services and amenities offered by the airline like inflight Wi-Fi and movies. 6. Aircraft Charter airlines have different aircrafts available to cater to different clientsâ€™ needs. Check what particular aircraft is needed for the flight. Among the factors to consider are: size, spaciousness and passenger capacity. Make sure the aircraft chosen fits the number of passengers going to be in the charter flight and can comfortably accommodate all the passengers. 7. Cost When considering the cost, donâ€™t stop at checking if itâ€™s within budget. Also check if the price is worth the facilities and services provided with the flight. Make sure to also check any additional fees or hidden charges that may be applied. Among the additional fees that may be incurred are: extra baggage, personal choice of pilot and flight attendants, and late night departures. These seven factors will serve as a guide for individuals and companies to pick the right jet charter that fits their needs. By considering these seven factors, you can make sure the private jet experience provided by the charter company is truly a convenient and comfortable one and is the best one you have.

Although the thought of swimming with the oceanâ€™s most feared creatures may be enough to send you packing your bags, thereâ€™s actually no reason to worry. Diving with sharks in Fiji is as fun and safe as the usual underwater explorations; however, the beauty and grand presence of natureâ€™s often misunderstood creature makes it all the more meaningful. A dive at Beqa Island gets you up close and personal with 8 species of sharks: nurse sharks, lemon sharks, silvertip sharks, whitetip reef sharks, blacktip reef sharks, bull sharks, grey reef sharks, and tiger sharks. 2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Surfing Ride the crests of the waves at Fijiâ€™s Frigates Passage, the perfect destination for surfing enthusiasts. Frigates is a word-class surfing spot, and a consistent one at that, as it showcases swells and waves all year round. Itâ€™s a powerful left-handed reef break that features some of its biggest waves from December until April. 3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Whitewater Rafting If you want to take a break from the white sandy beaches of Fiji, enjoying a whitewater rafting adventure in Upper Navua River is an experience you should never miss out on. This excursion will introduce you to Fijiâ€™s hidden yet phenomenal tropical wilderness. While enjoying the rush of the rapids on your inflatable raft, you will be filled with awe as you pass through the home of a variety of flora and fauna, countless waterfalls, and numerous side canyons. There are plenty of Fiji holiday deals that offer this type of activity so make sure you include this in your itinerary. 4.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Terra Trek Step away from the beach and into the tropical interior of Viti Levu Island by going on a Terra Trek. This is a guided tour that lets you take a peek at the other side of Fiji, its lush and pristine rainforest, lovely waterfalls, and scenic views of the Pacific Ocean and other islands. Terra Trek offers an offroad adventure as you will be able to drive through the forest and enjoy the cascades of the waterfalls after. 5.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Sea Kayaking Paddle through the waters of Fiji in a kayaking adventure at Beqa Island. Beqa Island is located south of the main island of Viti Levu. Aside from being the home of Fijiâ€™s famous firewalkers, Beqa Island also boasts of its clear and warm waters, mangroves, and secluded coves, perfect for a sea kayaking adventure. As you cruise through the lagoon, you will spot a fruit bat colony and other wildlife. Your guide will also be able to lead you to the Malumu Bay where a mangrove passage and a view of the Islands of Kadavu await, depending on the tides. There never is a shortage of fun and adventure in Fiji. So if youâ€™re planning to book a trip there, make sure you have all these in your itinerary, and donâ€™t forget to pack your essentials. But if you want to get away from it all, itâ€™s best to find Fiji all inclusive packages that cover all your needs.

<li><a href='http://activetraveltours.com/active_travel_tours/trails-the-hottest-trend-in-active-travel'>Trails the Hottest Trend in Active Travel</a><br />
Trails Provide Safety, Scenery & Security trail tours are for all ages Why are so many active travel tour companies starting to add more bike trails to their adventure travel itinerary? Trail lovers have known the answer to this question for years, but the active travel vacation companies are just starting to realize the benefits of trail travel and starting to provide more and more adventure tour options based around epic international trails like the Great Allegheny Passage trail in the United States and the Danube Cycle Way in Europe. Companies like HF Holidays are starting to add trail-based tours to their itinerariesÂ or, in the case of Â ROW Adventures, acquiring companies that already offer cycle path tours. What is so appealing about bike trail tours? Safety &#8211; Riding bikes on roads can be fairly dangerous under the best of circumstances. But riding bikes on roads, in a foreign country, in large groups, while looking at scenery is an accident waiting to happen. Bicycle paths eliminate the danger of bike-car collisions thus greatly enhancing the safety of a bike-based vacation and turning an adventure tour into an active tour. Scenery &#8211; Let&#8217;s face it; the scenery from roads is often more cluttered than beautiful. Bike trails are often built alongside rivers or canals and are much more conducive to gorgeous scenery than highways. In addition, the slower, less crowded nature of multi-use paths also allows for more time and opportunities to site-see at leisure. Road bike tours often have the same problem as vehicle-based tours. They&#8217;re fast-paced and sometimes dangerous. Security &#8211; This may sound the same as safety, but it&#8217;s a whole different animal. Cycle trails offer bicyclists a much less confusing route than road cycle tours. In many cases, bike riders can totally submerse themselves in the surrounding history, scenery and culture without worrying about getting off-track. Most major cycle trail routes are well marked and easy to follow. The bottom line is that bicycle trail vacations offer all the benefits of road bike tours but with added safety, scenery and security. Having said that, if your main reason for choosing a cycling vacation is to compete, go fast and get from point A to point B in a hurry, you may still want to consider a road riding tour. For the rest of you, it may be time that you start to investigate bike trail touring.

Group Vacation Planning You want to plan a bike tour with a group of friends. But it&#8217;s such a hassle to coordinate transportation, lodging, activities and trip dates.

Coordinate Travel Details Travelstormer allows friends to coordinate all the trip details from the brainstorming stage right down to flight schedules.. all in one central location.

Whether one person plans the whole trip or everyone has their role in the holiday planning, Travelstormer provides the tools to make it all happen.

Silver Bike Tours Offer Self-guided Bicycle Tours Silver Bike Tours has been offering self-guided bicycle tours since 2005. What sets Silver Bike Tours apart from the other companies is their devotion to tours on bike trails and bicycle paths. This allowed them to provide fun tours that were also safe for the entire family. Their tours included itineraries on Idaho&#8217;s Hiawatha Trail, the Trail of the Couer d&#8217; alenes in northern Idaho and the Spokane Centennial Trail in Washington State. Variety of Bike Tours Silver Bike Tours has a nice selection of active travel tours including bicycle tours of varying lengths and difficulties. Since many of their tours are self-guided, they are quite affordable. I am also pleased to report that Silver Bike Tours is flexible with certain other personal transportation vehicles such as Trikkes and recumbents. Although they only provide regular bikes with their currently offered tours, they will listen to proposals for other vehicles also, as long as the travelers are able to provide their own vehicles. Of course some vehicles may be too large to transport in the conventional manner, most portable vehicles like Trikkes and foldable recumbents may be considered. Be sure to discuss this with company representatives in advance. Self-Guided Bike Tours | Rails-to-Trails Bike Tours, Bike Adventures Silver Bike Tours Merges With Row Adventures And now, Silver Bike Tours is even better since it has become part of the Row Adventures family. It will keep it&#8217;s great bike trail tours and self-guided trips but also add some guided bicycle tours. I won&#8217;t go into great detail about this wonderful partnership in this blog-post because Active Travel Tours will be featuring a review of Row Adventures in an upcoming blog-post. Let it suffice to say though, that a good company just got better.
