A stroll on the Canopy Walkway, a 500-meter suspended bridge high in treetops, affords the rare opportunity to glimpse birds where they make their homes. A visit to the locals and a chance to chat with schoolchildren rounds out this exciting Amazon adventure.

The Inca ruins of Machu Picchu, which would be stunning anywhere, are truly spectacular in their Andean setting, high above the Urubamba River. And Cuzco, once the center of the Inca Empire and now a vibrant gateway to Inca ruins, is even higher in the Andes.Yet even at sea level, Peru can leave you breathless. With unspoiled beaches, coastal desert, deep canyons and dense Amazon jungle, its variety of natural wonders is astonishing.Then, there are the cultural treasures. The contrast between old and new runs throughout the land: Poncho-clad Amerindians walk their llamas through modern cities, past Spanish cathedrals built on the foundations of ancient Inca ruins. Giant, stylized designs were etched in the earth by a great - and unknown - civilization.Peru is where pre-Columbian culture reached its most graceful peak. Like the Parthenon in Greece or the Pyramids of Egypt, the Inca and pre-Inca ruins of Peru provide an unforgettable glimpse of the genius of a lost world.

<li><a href='http://www.adventureengine.com/sch_moreResults.php?tripid=trip2786'>iExplore Uruguay</a><br />
What Uruguay lacks in size, variety and dramatic landscapes it compensates for in hospitality. Knowing that their scenery and cultural attractions can&#039;t really compete with those of their neighbors, Brazil and Argentina, Uruguayans have focused their tourism efforts on establishing memorable small hotels and resorts. The result is a surprising variety of accommodations, ranging from swanky beach hideaways to rustic ranch retreats.The people of Uruguay, almost entirely of Spanish and Italian ancestry, are unique in South America in that they are mostly middle class - there aren&#039;t the extremes of wealth and poverty that plague the rest of the continent (a legacy of the country&#039;s progressive social services). As a result, the nation enjoys a relatively high standard of living and literacy.
<li><a href='http://www.adventureengine.com/sch_moreResults.php?tripid=trip2788'>iExplore Venezuela</a><br />
Venezuela has epic proportions: it has South America&#039;s largest lake and third-longest river, the highest waterfall in the world, and the longest of all snakes.

This program includes Los Glaciares National Park in Southern Patagonia, as well as the subtropical North-eastern region of Argentina, visiting the Ibera Marshlands and the Iguaz&uacute; Falls.The Iber&aacute; Marshlands is an almost unknown region of Argentina, covering an area three times larger than the Everglades, and with a surprising diversity of habitats such as marshlands, lakes, savannahs, palm groves and forests, and home for more than 340 species of birds, as well as 2 species of caimans, capybaras, marsh deer, yellow anacondas, maned wolves, howler monkeys and neotropical otters.As there are no hotels in the region and very few lodges you&#039;ll stay in a historical ranch, the Estancia San Juan Poriah&uacute;, which provides highly personalized quality services and eco-oriented excursions with naturalist guides, both diurnal and nocturnal. As the estancia is a cattle working ranch, you will also have the chance of observing the authentic gauchos (local cowboys) during their daily activities in the corrals and in the open county-side.The trip ends with a visit to the Iguaz&uacute; National Park, in the border with Brazil, where the highlight is the spectacular Iguaz&uacute; Falls.
<li><a href='http://www.adventureengine.com/sch_moreResults.php?tripid=trip2929'>iExplore Bolivia Silver</a><br />
More than a country, Bolivia is a conglomerate of ethnias with their particular visions and spirit. Usually aside from glamorous and traditional tourist circuits, Bolivia is now captivating the interest of people who wish to enjoy an astonishing and diverse nature and ancestral cultures, but at the same time to be witness of the peculiar process where the earliest ethnias have decided to open themselves to the outside world.

The ancient inhabitants of this 45-sq-mi/115-sq-km island called it Te Pito o Te Henua (the Navel of the World). Visitors today often call it the world&#039;s largest open-air museum. It has a fascinating - and tragic - history. Easter Island, the most isolated island in the world, is believed to have been settled by Polynesians who ventured across the Pacific from the Marquesas Islands. Settling on Rapa Nui (the Polynesian name for Easter Island), they tilled the land and used the native palm trees both for their houses and fishing boats. But their most spectacular and permanent constructions were the moais, huge images of gods carved from volcanic stone and set all around the island, facing the sea. (The moais are estimated to weigh 50-90 tons/45,000-80,000 kg.)The islanders believed the gods conferred mana, or spiritual power, keeping their fields fertile and the ocean fishes plentiful. All went well until the last palm tree was chopped down - then, all the mana on the island was insufficient to prevent soil erosion or to provide construction material for fishing boats. In about 1580, famine swept the island, and a series of civil wars followed, lasting 250 years. It was during these wars that Dutch navigator Jacob Roggeveen first saw the island on Easter Sunday, 1722.

iExplore Ecuador features visits to Quito, the Amazon and Otavalo. Quito, Ecuadors capital (and second-largest) city has a setting of great natural beauty, overshadowed by the volcano Pichincha with its twin peaks of Ruco and Guagua. The Amazon; El Oriente is the term used by Ecuadorians to refer to the Amazon basin in eastern Ecuador, a primeval world of virgin forests and exotic flora and fauna, still mainly inhabited by Indians. Otavalo; the peak of Mount Imbabura signals the approach to the valley of Otavalo (95km/60 miles from Quito), the town of the same name being famed for its craftwork and Indian market.
<li><a href='http://www.adventureengine.com/sch_moreResults.php?tripid=trip2946'>iExplore Ecuador Gold - Hacienda Hiking</a><br />
In the heart of South America, high on the equator lies a land of eternal spring and ever blooming flowers, where the towering giants of green volcanoes brush playfully against white puffs of passing clouds drifting in the wind currents of the deep blue Andean sky. Below these verdant slopes and clear skies where condors fly are rich agricultural valleys, sparkling lakes, colorful indigenous cultures and gracious haciendas that were once the backbone of Spanish colonial agrarian society.This setting has all the elements of classic inn-to-inn hiking one would expect to find in places like Tuscany and the Alps: breathtaking scenery, incomparable accommodations with historic architecture and excellent cuisine. Yet this trip has something more in the form of a thriving indigenous culture along with the living remnants of both ancient and colonial cultures. It also offers the opportunity to see wildlife found nowhere else. Because this trip is set on the equator it is available year round.Youll have the opportunity to stay at the same places where much of South Americas history was written. Hacienda San Augustin de Callo incorporates original walls of an Incan fortress into its structure. Hacienda Pinsaqui was a stopping off place for Simon Bolivar who tried to unite the region into a single country and Hacienda Zuleta is still home to the family of former president and amateur bullfighter Galo Plaza. Because these are long standing family homes youll enjoy a warm, welcoming hospitality unique to Ecuadors haciendas.We match this with a series of excellent hikes through the parklands that surround Ecuadors Avenue of the Volcanoesthe name given to this part of Ecuador by noted explorer Alexander van Humboldt who was a guest at Hacienda La Cienega where we will be having lunch. Here we will enjoy spectacular views of valleys crowned by some of the tallest snow-capped volcanoes in the world including 5897 meter Cotopaxi, 5790 meter Cayambe and 5,704 meter Antisana. Some of our hikes are along the original routes that linked the haciendas, while others are in wild national and regional parks, home to a number of endangered species including spectacle bear, puma and the legendary Andean Condor.Ecuadorian people offer a brand of cultural interaction not found in many destinations, writes respected travel writer David Noland. Many of the Native Americans here are descendants of the Inca (and many still speak Quechua, their original language); other mestizos are of mixed Native American and European ancestryThe fact that this area is less visited than some parts of Peru means that these Indians are much less jaded. We include visits to local markets including the Otavalo, which dates back to antiquity and is famous throughout the Andes for its handicrafts, textiles and tapestries.Like the once great landed estates of Europe, Ecuadors hacienda system formed the basis of agrarian economics during Spanish colonial times, when almost all of them were built and some haciendas remaining largely in tact. Their transition to the modern day makes for a world-class experience in a welcoming land of active volcanoes and indigenous tribes.
