      <p>By the mid 20th  century, humans had achieved a mastery of technology sufficient to leave the surface of the Earth for the first time and explore space.</p>
      <p>Technology is a broad concept that deals with a species' usage and knowledge of tools and crafts, and how it affects a species' ability to control and adapt to its environment. Technology is a term with origins in the Greek &quot;<em>technologia</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>τεχνολογία</em>&quot; — &quot;<em>techne</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>τέχνη</em>&quot; (&quot;craft&quot;) and &quot;<em>logia</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>λογία</em>&quot; (&quot;saying&quot;). However, a strict definition is elusive; &quot;technology&quot; can refer to material objects of use to humanity, such  as machines, hardware or utensils, but can also encompass broader themes, including systems, methods of organization, and techniques. The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include &quot;construction technology&quot;, &quot;medical technology&quot;, or &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-of-the-art">state-of-the-art</a> technology&quot;.</p>
      <p>The human race's use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistorical discovery of the ability to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and  the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.</p>
      <p>Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of the Earth and its environment.  Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.</p>
      <p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, claiming that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of  ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.</p>
      <p><strong>Definition and usage</strong><br>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Handtiegelpresse_von_1811.jpg"><img border="0" width="63" height="95" src="images/image002.jpg"></a><br>
          <em>The invention of the printing press made it possible for scientists and politicians to communicate their ideas with ease, leading to the Age of Enlightenment; an example of technology as a cultural force.</em><p>
        In general <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/technology">technology</a> is the relationship that society has with its tools and crafts, and to what  extent society can control its environment. The Merriam-Webster dictionary  offers a definition of the term: &quot;the practical application of knowledge especially in a particular area&quot; and &quot;a capability given by the  practical application of knowledge&quot;. Ursula Franklin, in her 1989  &quot;Real World of Technology&quot; lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is &quot;practice, the way we do things around here&quot;. The term is often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics, rather than technology as a whole. Bernard  Stiegler, in <em>Technics and Time, 1</em>, defines technology in two ways: as &quot;the pursuit of life by means other than life&quot;, and as  &quot;organized inorganic matter.&quot; <p>
        Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In  this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve  real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a crowbar or wooden spoon, or more complex machines, such as a space station or particle accelerator. Tools and machines need not be material; virtual technology, such as computer software and business methods, fall under  this definition of technology. <p>
        The word &quot;technology&quot; can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques. In this context, it is the current state of humanity's knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill needs, or satisfy wants; it includes technical methods, skills, processes, techniques, tools and raw  materials. When combined with another term, such as &quot;medical technology&quot; or &quot;space technology&quot;, it refers to the state of the  respective field's knowledge and tools. &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-of-the-art">State-of-the-art</a> technology&quot; refers to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_technology">high  technology</a> available to humanity in any field.<p>
        Technology can be viewed as an  activity that forms or changes culture. Additionally, technology is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of communication technology, which has  lessened barriers to human interaction and, as a result, has helped spawn new  subcultures; the rise of cyberculture has, at its basis, the development of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a>.  Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help  facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both science and engineering, each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.</div>
