            Air Parks</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; Maine Airparks began as a dream but with
            perseverance this dream can mature into an actual business and potentially
            several residential developments. We recently have discovered an undeveloped
            private airport along the Maine coast that is very well suited to become
            our first airpark. This largely undeveloped private airport features
            a well drained 3200X100’ turf runway surrounded by pines and hardwoods
            with enough room for 20-30 house lots with direct runway access. </p>
