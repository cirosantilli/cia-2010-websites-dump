There has been an intense research interest in all two-dimensional (2D) forms of carbon since Geim and Novoselov's discovery of graphene in 2004. But as the number of such publications rise, so does the level of inconsistency in naming the material of interest. The isolated, single-atom-thick sheet universally referred to as "graphene" may have a clear definition, but when referring to related 2D sheet-like or flake-like carbon forms, many authors have simply defined their own terms to describe their product. This has led to confusion within the literature, where terms are multiply-defined, or incorrectly used. Experts have now published the first recommended nomenclature for 2D carbon forms.

The answer is in homogeneous stress distribution between a surface and the adhesive element.

Researchers report that they have created a human-made catalyst that is an "enzyme mimic." Unlike most enzymes, which act on a single target, the new catalyst can alter the chemical profiles of numerous types of small molecules. The catalyst -- and others like it -- will greatly speed the process of drug discovery, the researchers say. Their findings appear in the Journal of the American Chemistry Society.

Three-dimensional printers can make artists' and hobbyists' dreams a reality, opening up a new world of inexpensive, on-demand plastic parts manufacturing, but there's also a dark side. As these printers -- now available at major U.S. retail stores -- become more popular, concerns are growing about their use for designing and building custom plastic firearms -- weapons that could conceivably go undetected.

Popeye, the comic book hero, swears by it as do generations of parents who delight their children with spinach. Of course, today it is known that the vegetable is not quite as rich in iron as originally thought, but that iron is nevertheless essential for our physical well-being is undisputed. Lack of iron -- caused by malnutrition -- can lead to anemia while an increased level of iron may signal the presence of an acute inflammatory response. Therefore, the blood iron level is an important medical diagnostic agent. Researchers have now developed a novel biosensor for determination of iron content that is based on nanodiamonds.

To meet a goal set by the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Renewable Fuels Standard to use 36 billion gallons of biofuels each year -- mostly ethanol -- the nation must expand its infrastructure for transporting and storing ethanol. Ethanol, however, is known for triggering stress corrosion cracking of steel. Researchers investigated the mechanism of how ethanol triggers stress corrosion cracking, along with ways to circumvent this issue to prevent ethanol-related corrosion issues.

A new study has found that “waviness” in forests of carbon nanotubes dramatically reduces their stiffness. Instead of being a detriment, the waviness may make the nanotube arrays more useful as thermal interface material for conducting heat away from integrated circuits.
