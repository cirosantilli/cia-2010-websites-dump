Neutrinos are the most elusive particles having extremely weak interactions with all other particles.

Now scientists have obtained new strong limits for the so-called neutrino-less double beta decay, which tests if neutrinos are their own antiparticles.

Researchers have developed a new metallic bubble wrap that is lighter, stronger and more flexible than sheet metal and more heat- and chemical-resistant than plastic or other polymer-based bubble wraps. Potential applications include automobile body panels, the wing edges of airplanes, suitcases, helmets and cases for computers and other electronic devices.

A breakthrough in our understanding of the properties of titania (titanium dioxide) -- the basis of self-cleaning window technology -- has been made by scientists, uncovering a decades old misunderstanding that has clouded our knowledge of how mixed phase titania catalysts operate.

Scientists have used a range of analytical methods to identify the techniques used by violin master Antonio Stradivari in the 17th century, and attempted to replicate his craftsmanship. Antonio Stradivari is universally recognized as one of the most famous violin makers in the world. During his life, he and his apprentices built more than a thousand violins, violas, cellos and other stringed instruments.

Researchers have for the first time created perfect one-dimensional molecular wires of which the electrical conductivity can almost entirely be suppressed by a weak magnetic field at room temperature. The underlying mechanism is possibly closely related to the biological compass used by some migratory birds. This spectacular discovery may lead to radically new magnetic field sensors, for smartphones for example.

If a liquid metal alloy is cooled slowly it will eventually form a solid phase. Before it solidifies, however, the liquid undergoes a liquid-liquid transition to a phase in which it has the same concentration but a more strongly ordered structure. This structure has now been demonstrated for the first time by material scientists.

The radioactive element astatine, the name of which is derived from the Greek word for 'instability,' is so rare on Earth that it has not yet been investigated to any greater extent and, as a consequence, very little is known about it. Using artificially generated astatine, a physicist has now managed for the first time to experimentally explore one of its fundamental parameters, the ionization potential, and thus determine one of the most important properties of the rare element.
