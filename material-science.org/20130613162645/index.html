A colloid is a substance spread out evenly inside another substance. Everyday examples include milk, styrofoam, hair sprays, paints, shaving foam, gels and even dust, mud and fog. One of the most interesting properties of colloids is their ability to self-assemble -- to aggregate spontaneously into well-defined structures, driven by nothing but local interactions between the colloid's particles. Self-assembly has been of major interest in industry, since controlling it would open up a whole host of new technologies, such as smart drug-delivery patches or novel paints that change with light. Scientists have now discovered a technique to control and direct the self-assembly of two different colloids.

Nanotechnologies require a  detailed knowledge of the molecular state. For instance, it is useful to know when and how a generic polymer, a long chain of polymers (chain of beads), knots. The study of molecular entanglement  is an important field of study as the presence of knots affects its physical properties, for instance the resistence to traction. Previous studies had mainly obtained “static” data on the knotting probability of such molecules. In other words, they focused on the likelihood that a polymer may knot. The novelty of the new study lies in the fact that this time the dynamic aspect of the phenomenon has been simulated.

It's not easy going green. For home lighting applications, organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) hold the promise of being both environmentally friendly and versatile. Though not as efficient as regular light-emitting diodes (LEDs), they offer a wider range of material choices and are more energy efficient than traditional lights. OLEDs can also be applied to flexible surfaces, which may lead to lights or television displays that can be rolled up and stowed in a pocket.

Scientists have dramatically improved the performance of lithium-ion batteries by creating novel electrodes made of silicon and conducting polymer hydrogel, a spongy material similar to that used in contact lenses and other household products. The scientists developed a new technique for producing low-cost, silicon-based batteries with potential applications for a wide range of electrical devices.

The development of structured synthetic materials with unusual electromagnetic properties, so-called metamaterials, promises to provide access to special physical effects of great technological interest. Metamaterials have already been fabricated that have a negative refractive index for electromagnetic waves -- bending them in the opposite sense to light waves entering water, for instance -- which opens up completely novel opportunities for the manipulation of light. One of these makes it possible, in principle, to create cloaking devices that seem to make objects disappear. Indeed, such an invisibility cloak has already been realized for microwaves.

Laser researchers are challenging a basic assumption of engineering: "You can't have it all." They have shown that for applications in biomedical optics, material processing, and communications, a new approach could deliver desired capabilities with no problematic tradeoffs: In compact, inexpensive, efficient and long-lived lasers that produce ultrashort, high-energy light pulses. They present experimental results with pulses as short as 60 picoseconds and predict that this technique will allow practical subpicosecond devices.

Researchers now want to use this gift of nature as a building material – to wit, for the insulation of outer walls or reinforcement of plaster.

Engineering researchers demonstrate that graphene, even if stitched together from many small crystalline grains, is almost as strong as graphene in its perfect crystalline form. This resolves a contradiction between theoretical simulations, which predicted grain boundaries can be strong, and earlier experiments, which indicated they were much weaker than the perfect lattice.
