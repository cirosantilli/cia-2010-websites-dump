Both Christian and Muslim communities have been affected by the conflict. Many of us have been displaced and have witnessed the horrors that conflict imposes on people's lives. But without addressing the root causes of the conflict – especially the poverty, inequality and political exclusion that has driven so many into the hands of violent extremists – real peace may remain elusive.</p><p>Vital to the sustained success of any peace agreement is for ordinary people to feel that their interests are best served by peace, and this will require patient peace-building at the community level. UK agency Cafod has been supporting Ecoweb to undertake this peace-building work, and our message is simple: we cannot face another cycle of violent conflict in Mindanao, and we must all do our part to prevent it.<br /><strong>Nanette Salvador-Antequisa</strong><br /><em>Executive director, Ecoweb, Philippines</em></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/philippines">Philippines</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific">Asia Pacific</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism">Global terrorism</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
