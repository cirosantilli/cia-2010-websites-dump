Do articles about the U.N. really have to be relentlessly depressing? Over the past six months, this column has dwelt on such bleak topics as the Security Council&rsquo;s failure to halt the Syrian crisis and the mounting dangers of U.N. peacekeeping in various trouble-spots. Yet despite the bad news, it is arguable that the U.N. has had a good year on many other fronts, and focusing solely on its problems is unfair.

Negotiators are making steady progress toward ending a conflict between Colombia's government and its largest leftist guerrilla group, the 49-year-old Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). But the FARC are not Colombia's only leftist guerrilla group with a national presence.

Given the recent prominence in international affairs of seemingly intractable disputes over maritime rights, it appears to be time for a 21st-century version of Otto von Bismarck to convene a set of international conferences to settle some of today&rsquo;s stand-offs. Since some of the most dangerous flashpoints are literally little more than rocks, someone with a Bismarckian sense of perspective is sorely needed.

A reform push in Mexico that many have termed historic could get epic this fall. That&rsquo;s when President Enrique Pena Nieto will introduce plans to reform the oil and gas sector and overhaul the country&rsquo;s tax system. But while economists share a broad consensus that Mexico&rsquo;s growth and long-term vitality rely on the passage of these plans, there is not significant public support for the reform of the oil sector.
