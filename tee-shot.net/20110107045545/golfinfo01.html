<p>Golf is usually regarded as a Scottish invention, as the game was mentioned in two 15th-century laws prohibiting the playing of the game of &quot;gowf&quot;.&nbsp; Some scholars, however, suggest that this refers to another game which is much akin to shinty or hurling, or to modern field hockey.&nbsp; They point out that a game of putting a small ball in a hole in the ground using golf clubs was played in 17th-century Netherlands. <br>
        <br>
        The term golf is believed to have originated from a Germanic word for &quot;club&quot;.  
  &nbsp;The oldest playing golf course in the world is The Old Links at Musselburgh.&nbsp; Evidence has shown that golf was played on Musselburgh Links in 1672 although Mary Queen of Scots reputedly played there in 1567.<br>
  <br>
  Golf courses have not always had eighteen holes.&nbsp; The St Andrews Links occupy a narrow strip of land along the sea.&nbsp; As early as the 15th century, golfers at St. Andrews established a customary route through the undulating terrain, playing to holes whose locations were dictated by topography.&nbsp; The course that emerged featured eleven holes, laid out end to end from the clubhouse to the far end of the property. &nbsp;One played the holes out, turned around, and played the holes in, for a total of 22 holes.<br>
  <br> 
  In 1764, several of the holes were deemed too short, and were therefore combined. &nbsp;The number was thereby reduced from 11 to nine, so that a complete round of the links comprised 18 holes. 
       &nbsp; The major changes in equipment since the 19th century have been better mowers, especially for the greens, better golf ball designs, using rubber and man-made materials since about 1900, and the introduction of the metal shaft beginning in the 1930s. &nbsp;&nbsp;Also in the 1930s the wooden golf tee was invented. &nbsp;In the 1970s the use of metal to replace wood heads began, and shafts made of graphite composite materials were introduced in the 1980s.<br>
       <br>
      It was reported in January 2006 that recent evidence unearthed by Prof. Ling Hongling of Lanzhou University suggests that a game similar to modern-day golf was played in China at least 500 years before golf was first mentioned in Scotland.&nbsp; Archives called the Dongzuan Records from the Song Dynasty describe a game called chuiwan and also include drawings. &nbsp;It was played with 10 clubs including a cuanbang, pubang, and shaobang, which are comparable to a driver, two-wood, and three-wood. <br>
      <br>
      The archive also includes references to a Nan Tang Dynasty magistrate who asked his daughter to make &quot;holes&quot; for him to play, and describes his &quot;tee&quot; as being jewel-encrusted. &nbsp;There were further descriptions of clubs being inlaid with jade and gold, suggesting golf was for the wealthy.&nbsp; Hongling suggested golf may have been exported to Europe and then Scotland by Mongolian travellers in the late Middle Ages- although there is no evidence for this.</p>

      <p><b>History of the Golf Ball</b></p>
      <p>Wooden balls were used until the early 17th century, when the featherie ball was invented. A featherie is a handsewn cowhide bag stuffed with goose feathers and coated with paint. Due to its superior flight characteristics, the featherie remained the standard ball for more than two centuries.<br>
        In 1848, the Rev. Dr. Robert Adams invented the gutta percha ball (or guttie). Because gutties were cheaper to produce and could be manufactured with textured surfaces to improve their aerodynamic qualities, they replaced feather balls completely within a few years.<br>
        In the twentieth century, multi-layer balls were developed, first as wound balls consisting of a solid or liquid-filled core wound with a layer of rubber thread and a thin outer shell. This design allowed manufacturers to fine-tune the length, spin and &quot;feel&quot; characteristics of balls. Wound balls were especially valued for their soft feel.<br>
      Today's golf balls usually consist of a two-, three-, or four-layer design, consisting of various synthetic materials like surlyn or urethane blends. They are available in a great variety of playing characteristics to suit the needs of golfers of different proficiency. </p>
