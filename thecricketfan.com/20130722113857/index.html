Just two wickets in it, and one of those was ludicrous. Joe Root has come off age, proving once and for all that he deserves to be at the top of the order and will be there for a while. Might have been interesting to see Cook declare tonight and have 10 overs at Australia - you&amp;#039;d think they&amp;#039;re be more exhausted tonight than after a night&amp;#039;s sleep - but it&amp;#039;s hard to see them
