    The Tonight Show 1962 - 1972</b><br>
    The Jack Paar era of the Tonight Show ended on March 29, 1962. Unfortunately 
    NBC's chosen replacement could not start immediately, so late-night viewers 
    experienced another 26-week temporary version of the Tonight Show. From April 
    until September, the Tonight Show was hosted by a succession of guest hosts, 
    usually appearing for one week at a time. Hugh Downs stayed on as the announcer, 
    and Skitch Henderson returned to lead the band during the transition period. 
    During this short segment, we experienced a tremendously varied parade of 
    hosts, including Soupy Sales, Art Linkletter, Groucho Marx, Merv Griffin, 
    and Jerry Lewis. We even saw the first woman, Arlene Francis, appear as guest-host. 
    Though not exactly stellar, this six-month period of the Tonight Show proved 
    more successful than the 1957 ratings disaster, Tonight: America After Dark.<br>
    </font><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="2"><br>
    Johnny Carson had originally turned down NBC's late-night offer. Luckily he 
    reconsidered and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson premiered on October 
    1, 1962. Skitch Henderson stayed on as band leader, but Johnny brought Ed 
    McMahon with him as his announcer. Ed McMahon had been Johnny's announcer 
    on the quiz show Who Do You Trust? for the previous five years. Johnny also 
    brought his brother, Dick Carson onboard as director. The very first guests 
    on Johnny's new Tonight Show were Rudy Vallee, Joan Crawford, Mel Brooks, 
    and Tony Bennett. Johnny intentionally discouraged the constant turmoil and 
    confrontations that had been common on Jack Paar's Tonight Show. Johnny's 
    goal was to entertain people, and no one did it better. The show opened to 
    good reviews, and was off to a strong start in the ratings. Most of America 
    was safely tucked in every weeknight by Johnny Carson. Bedtime schedules were 
    set not by the clock, but by Johnny Carson's monologue. <br>
    <br>
    Skitch Henderson decided to leave the show in 1966, and trumpet playing Doc 
    Severinsen took over as bandleader in 1967. Johnny's most serious dispute 
    with NBC also happened in 1967. Johnny honored a strike by members of AFTRA, 
    a performers' trade union, and NBC aired reruns of Carson's shows, without 
    his consent during his absence. Since Johnny believed this was a violation 
    of his own contract, Johnny refused to return to the Tonight Show until the 
    AFTRA strike was settled, and NBC had negotiated a new contract with him. 
    As a result of this disagreement, Johnny took a much more active role in production 
    and financial arrangements for the show. There were multiple producer changes, 
    brother Dick Carson left the show in 1968, and Raritan Enterprises was created 
    in 1969, with Sonny Werblin as a partner, to handle production matters for 
    The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and other Johnny Carson business ventures. 
    The show had been broadcast remotely from the West Coast numerous times, but 
    a business decision was made in 1972 to move the Tonight Show to Los Angeles 
    permanently. <br>
    <br>
    Johnny Carson had little competition during the 10 years that his show was 
    located in New York. ABC's first attempt at a late-night talk show debuted 
    in November, 1964 with Les Crane as the host. The Les Crane Show used a special 
    &quot;shotgun&quot; microphone to allow audience members to talk to, and interact 
    with, Les's guests each night. After only four months, ABC decided this format 
    wasn't working, changed to a series of weekly guest hosts, and renamed the 
    show, Nightlife. By early June, ABC changed the show again. They brought Les 
    Crane back as host, assisted by Nipsey Russell, and the show featured the 
    Elliott Lawrence Orchestra. In 1967, Joey Bishop took over the host's chair 
    for ABC's late-night talk show. Joey's sidekick was Regis Philbin and music 
    was provided by Johnny Mann and His Merry Men. Despite low ratings, The Joey 
    Bishop Show lasted over two years. But in 1969, Dick Cavett stepped in to 
    try to bolster ratings. Dick brought an announcer with him called Fred Foy. 
    Fred was best known as the announcer for The Lone Ranger. Dick also brought 
    a band leader he had worked with before, drummer Bobby Rosengarten. The Dick 
    Cavett Show continued until the end of 1974. The broadcast frequency, however, 
    faded from five nights a weeks, to three nights a week, to twice monthly, 
    as ratings continued to slip. CBS had only one entry in the late-night race 
    during the Tonight Show's New York years. The Merv Griffin Show was broadcast 
    from August, 1969 to February, 1972. Merv's announcer was Arthur Treacher, 
    and music was provided by the Mort Lindsey Orchestra. <br>

    1972 - 1992</b><br>
    In 1972 Johnny Carson began taping The Tonight Show from the NBC studios in 
    Burbank. After the relocation it was much easier for Johnny to book the hottest 
    Hollywood celebrities, and his show became the ultimate showcase for up and 
    coming young stars. New comics were especially eager to appear on The Tonight 
    Show. They were convinced that exposure on Johnny's show was the first step 
    on the road to fame and fortune. Jerry Seinfeld, Roseanne, and Garry Shandling 
    are a few of the lucky chosen few who got their six minutes of fame on Johnny's 
    show. <br>
    <br>
    Johnny negotiated a new contract with NBC in 1977 that gave him plenty of 
    money ($2M+ per year), and plenty of time off. His taping schedule included 
    12 weeks of 4 shows weekly, 25 weeks of taping only 3 shows a week, and 15 
    weeks of vacation. With that schedule, there was a tremendous increase in 
    the number and frequency of guest hosts. The list of guest hosts who appeared 
    regularly included such celebrities as Bob Newhart, John Davidson, David Brenner, 
    McLean Stevenson, and Jerry Lewis. Johnny Carson acquired total ownership 
    of the program in 1980, and trimmed the length of the show from 90 down to 
    60 minutes. In 1983, Joan Rivers was named as Johnny's permanent substitute 
    host. Joan left The Tonight Show rather abruptly in 1986 after she discovered 
    that NBC was not considering her as Johnny's permanent replacement. Garry 
    Shandling stepped in as a frequent guest host until Jay Leno finally took 
    over as permanent guest host. <br>
    <br>
    Even though rumors had flown for years about Johnny's retirement, the audience 
    (and the network) was shocked and surprised when he made the official announcement 
    in May of 1991 at a network affiliate meeting in New York. He repeated the 
    announcement that night when he appeared on Late Night with David Letterman. 
    Johnny Carson had decided to leave The Tonight Show in May of 1992. NBC had 
    been preparing for this day. Jay Leno, the permanent guest host, had been 
    offered a contract with NBC long before Johnny made his announcement. That 
    contract promised The Tonight Show to Jay Leno upon Johnny's departure. Robin 
    Williams and Bette Midler were Johnny's last guests on May 21, 1992. But Johnny's 
    final show featured no guests at all. Johnny, with Ed McMahon and Doc Severinsen, 
    talked about their favorite Tonight Show memories and showed clips from previous 
    shows to an audience estimated at 50 million viewers. <br>
