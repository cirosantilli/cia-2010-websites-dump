In a generation of golfers 35 and under, several men seem poised to win their first major tournament as the P.G.A. Championship closes out the year's majors.

After a television viewer alerted Masters officials to an illegal drop by Tiger Woods, the PGA Tour may have to cope with an influx of amateur rules experts.

The U.S.G.A. and the Royal and Ancient said in a statement that Tiger Woods violated the Rules of Golf during last month’s Masters tournament.

Adam Scott is the first Masters winner and the fourth winner in the last six majors to use an anchored putting stroke, which soon could face a ban by golf’s governing body.

Adam Scott rewrote his own history at the Masters and became a champion everyone could love.

Adam Scott, beating Ángel Cabrera in a playoff, exorcised the memories of Greg Norman’s collapse at the 1996 Masters and his own collapse at the 2012 British Open.
