<p>CDMA is a digital wireless
  technology. It is a general type of technology, implemented in many specific
  technologies. But the term &quot;CDMA&quot; is also commonly used to refer to
  one specific family of technologies (IS-95 and CDMA2000) that competes with
  technologies such as GSM.<br>
  <br>
  CDMA is a &quot;spread spectrum&quot; technology, which means that it spreads
  the information contained in a particular signal of interest over a much
  greater bandwidth than the original signal.<br>
  <br>
  Unlike many competing technologies, CDMA has no hard limit for the number of
  users who may share one base station (tower). Instead, with CDMA, additional
  users can connect until the base station determines that call quality would
  suffer beyond a set limit.<br>
  <br>
  CDMA (IS-95) systems have been in commercial operation since 1995. CDMA
  networks operate in the 800 and 1900 MHz frequency bands with primary markets
  in the
  <st1:country-region w:st="on">Americas</st1:country-region>
  and
  <st1:place
w:st="on">
  Asia
  . IS-95 CDMA systems are sometimes referred to as
  cdmaOne. The next evolutionary step for CDMA to 3G services is cdma2000. </p>
<p>CDMA is altering the face
  of cellular and PCS communication by: </p>
<p>    *Dramatically improving the telephone
  traffic capacity </p>
<p>    *Dramatically improving the voice quality
  and eliminating the audible effects of multipath fading </p>
<p>    *Reducing the incidence of dropped calls
  due to handoff failures </p>
<p>    *Providing reliable transport mechanism for
  data communications, such as facsimile and internet traffic </p>
<p>    *Reducing the number of sites needed to
  support any given amount of traffic </p>
<p>    *Simplifying site selection </p>
<p>    *Reducing deployment and operating costs
  because fewer cell sites are needed </p>
<p>    *Reducing average transmitted power </p>
<p>    *Reducing interference to other electronic
  devices </p>
<p>    *Reducing potential health risks </p>
