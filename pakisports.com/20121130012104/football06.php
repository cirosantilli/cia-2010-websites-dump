Kuala Lumpur: The AFC Competitions Committee on Wednesday decided to give the hosting rights of the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup to Maldives. The committee, under the chairmanship of AFC Vice-President the UAE‚Äôs Yousuf Al Serkal, ratified the decision of the Organising Committee for AFC President‚Äôs Cup & AFC Challenge Cup to appoint Maldives as a host of the next edition of this eight-team Finals. At the outset, AFC Acting President Zhang Jilong complimented the committee members for the growing stature of AFC competitions. ‚ÄúAll our competitions are growing in popularity and level of standard has also increased many folds. I would like to thank you for your contribution in this committee,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI would like to urge you to share your knowledge and experience which will help the AFC competitions in a big way.‚Äù Al Serkal said it was a wonderful year for AFC and its competitions as the Asian youngsters showcased their skills at the AFC U-16 and U-19 Championships. ‚ÄúThe future stars of Asia descended in Iran and the UAE during these two youth championships and I am sure many of the players will find places in their respective teams,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe technical level of teams was excellent during these tournaments and I would like to congratulate the Member Associations who participated in these tournaments for their hard work.‚Äù The committee also proposed the 2013 AFC Champions League slots to the AFC Executive Committee, which will meet on Thursday. However, the members decided to hold the final of the ACL on home and away basis next year. The proposals from the AFC Asian Cup Task Force were presented and approved for the 2019 edition onwards. The members agreed to maintain 16-team Finals for 2019 and the winners of the AFC Challenge Cup 2016 and 2018 will no more get direct slots in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup but will have to play the play-offs with the two best remaining teams from the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers who failed to qualify for the Finals. The committee also approved DPR Korea‚Äôs exclusion from future AFC Challenge Cups and maintain automatic qualification for top three teams from the 2015 edition in the next edition. Taking into consideration the views of AFC Technical Committee, the members decided to maintain a format of festival for U-14 age group rather than organising AFC U-14 Championship. The committee also approved AFC Calendar for 2013, AFC Asian Cup 2019 bidding procedure and timeline, 2014 AFC Challenge Cup regulations, 2014 AFC U-19 and U-16 Championships regulations, participation of Selangor in the 2013 AFC Cup, format for 2013 AFC Champions League and AFC Cup R16 and the final, Tajikistan clubs‚Äô participation in the AFC Cup, Palestinian club‚Äôs participation in the AFC President‚Äôs Cup, formation of a panel to investigate match-fixing cases.

<li>‚ÄòZavisa being put under pressure by PFF‚Äô<br />
KARACHI: Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) have started pressurising national coach Zavisa Milosavljevic as the Serbian has been served with a notice, asking him to explain why he is violating rules and interfering in the affairs of the federation, well-placed sources confided to ‚ÄòThe News‚Äô on Tuesday. Zavisa had been stopped from talking to the media without prior approval from the PFF the other day. Sources said that the coach had not done anything wrong but in order to hide their own follies the PFF has been opting for such tactics. The PFF had rebuked the coach for giving statements to the media about the poor ground conditions in Pakistan a few months back. Sources claimed that the coach was very disturbed following the development. Zavisa has been supervising the national Under-23 team at the Model Town Football Academy Ground in Lahore for the international tournament in Sri Lanka early next month. The PFF had claimed after signing Zavisa for two years as national coach on November 5 last year that the Serbian had been given free hand, but the restrictions imposed on him now negate that claim. The PFF had also used such tactics against the Austrian coach George Kottan during his one-year stay in Pakistan from February 2009 to February 2010. Kottan too was very critical of the PFF policies and the way football is run in Pakistan. But the Austrian never bowed before the PFF pressure and kept serving as national team coach quite freely. The PFF also used to keep under control Bahraini coach Salman Ahmed Sharida who had a fine record as Pakistan coach in 2005-06. The PFF used to interfere in his affairs which forced Sharida to quit his job soon after the 2006 Doha Asian Games. In that continental event Pakistan had performed well by giving tough time to such teams as Syria and Japan. The PFF in May this year had sacked assistant coach and manager Gohar Zaman for negligence just before the Under-22 team tour of Thailand. And just before the senior team‚Äôs recent tour of Singapore the PFF unceremoniously removed assistant coach Nasir Ismail without giving any concrete reason. Sources said that the PFF did not have any sound and full-time technical director and if Zavisa was also kept under pressure it would disturb the whole development process. The tactics being used by the PFF against Zavisa show that the foreigner will have to be more cautious in future if he wants to continue his job. ‚ÄúI think Zavisa should not think that he is fully authorised. If he continues to go against the wishes of the PFF he may lose his job well before the expiry of his contract,‚Äù sources said. The PFF sacked former coach Akhtar Mohiuddin after Pakistan‚Äôs exit from the 2008 SAFF Championship even before he had returned to the country from Maldives. From: The News, 28 Nov 2012
<li>Time for Pakistan to take a page out of the Filipino book [Dawn]<br />
Pakistan team that lost 4-0 to Singapore (by Alfie Lee &#8211; FAS) † by Ali Ahsan for Dawn.Com Pakistan‚Äôs much awaited Singapore trip ‚Äì the team‚Äôs first proper senior international outing since the 2011 SAFF Championship disappointment almost a year ago ‚Äì came to a humbling conclusion. A well-oiled and well-prepared Singaporean side, gearing up for the prestigious AFF Suzuki Cup 2012, showed some key weaknesses of the Pakistan national team. After a 0-1 loss at the hands of a Singapore Selection side (U23s), the international friendly finished 4-0 in favour of the hosts on 19 November. It was evidence of the fact that the fortunes of the national team will not change by simply stocking up the team with overseas-based players. Those players need maximum opportunities to play more matches together to form a good combination. The discovery of Denmark-based strikers Mohammad Ali (BK Avatra) and Hassan Bashir (HIK), who both came close to scoring on debut, were one of the few positives from the tour. There is a lot to ponder for the next set of games. While local players such as Saeed Ahmed (Muslim FC Chaman) have shown promise, ‚Äòflat track bullies‚Äô such as Kaleemullah (KRL) and Muhammad Rasool (KESC) have struggled to show their domestic scoring prowess at international stage. Kaleemullah has yet to score since graduating from the U19s to the senior side in 2010 and topping the PPFL scoring charts effortlessly. It was unfortunate for former Manchester United trainee Adnan Ahmed (Nelson FC) to miss the main game due to an injury he had sustained in the loss to Singapore Selection side. The midfielder would have no doubt tried to control the tempo of the game, something which the KRL duo of Muhammad Adil and Zia-us-Salam could not cope with at all. It also showed Pakistan‚Äôs coach Zavisa Milosavljevic that without Adnan, Pakistan‚Äôs midfield is paper thin and retaining possession and creating chances a worry. Once Adnan is available for next game, Zavisa must look to team him up with a midfield partner of similar calibre. Another young Pakistani-origin player Luke Dean, formerly at Bradford City, seems to be an ideal double act who could work with Adnan. Also, the most experienced but now low on pace Amjad Iqbal (Bradford Park Avenue) can move into defence. Luke has been rock solid for his new club Harrogate Town AFC in the Blue Square Bet North (Conference North), collecting various Man of the Match performances alongside player of the month in August. He now plays in same league as Shabir Khan (Worcester City) and Amjad. KRL‚Äôs Rizwan Asif and Kaleemullah can provide ample support on the wings if Zavisa decides to stick with 4-4-2. With Wales-based defensive favourite Atif Bashir out for long term due to injury, Zavisa has a few options at the back. While some may say, with overseas players, Pakistan concedes more goals such as in 2011 AFC Challenge Cup Qualifiers and 2014 WC Qualifiers vs Bangladesh, the reality of the situation is that it is a combination of these players and the locally based ones that leads to such a situation. The partnership just does not work because of the limited time these play together as a unit. The 2009 SAFF Cup showed that when playing together at the back these overseas players can do a great job. In the Cup they held firm in defense and did not concede even a single goal in 3 games. The line-up included three overseas-based players out of the four at the back. They were Shabir Khan, Atif Bashir and Amjad Iqbal. Zavisa now has Danish Superliga‚Äôs Nabil Aslam (AC Horsens) at his disposal alongside Zesh Rehman and Shabir Khan, but what is lacking is leadership and experience. For that he must turn to Amjad Iqbal. The science lecturer maybe 31 and has broken his leg twice in last two years but he is still as fit as ever and more experienced with natural ability to lead. Pairing Amjad and Nabil at heart of the defence the coach can make use of Zesh‚Äôs attacking instinct by playing him right back and Shabir as left back. While the youngster Omar Malik from Norwegian side FK T√∏nsberg has shown promise, he needs more opportunities with the team to come to terms with what is required from him. Coming from rural Norway and 2nd Division football he is new to this stage but there is no doubt about the talent and ability of Omar. There is also Yaqoob Butt, the brother of goalkeeper Yousuf, playing in 2nd Division of Denmark after returning from a long injury lay-off. The 6‚Äô4 Yaqoob is a tough tackling and versatile player who can operate as a defender or a defensive midfielder. Some may say that this type of approach will hurt domestic talent but the matter of fact is not much of it is up to the required standard. The players can go on tours and play against international sides but they cannot improve very much due to the substandard league they play in. No matter what a national team coach does with them, they will go back into same old crash-bang routine with their departments at home. This is why the locals and overseas players must compete for places for the best players to get the nod. Pakistan in this regard should learn from Philippines who have extensively utilized this approach for short and medium term since only a handful of their local players are good enough to compete with the foreign-based players from Europe. The Philippines have gone from being whipping boys of ASEAN region to hot favourites for the regional competitions because they have decided to pick the best Filipinos players from all over the world to form the best team. It shouldn‚Äôt be about local versus foreigner, but it should be about putting the best side out for Pakistan. Just because one is from Europe doesn‚Äôt mean he should be an automatic choice nor should be the local just because he plays for an influential government department. Only genuine competition for starting spots, as well as more regular international friendlies for senior team, can gradually help Pakistani football.
