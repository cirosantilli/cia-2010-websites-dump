<li>Lakers awful at free throws so far this season<br />
Forget Hack a Dwight. Opposing teams may just want to adopt this strategy to win games: Hack the Lakers. The Lakers rank 29th out of 30 NBA teams in free-throw shooting at 66.8 percent. In four of the Lakers&#8217; eight losses, the margin between made and missed free throws exceeded the point differential between winning and losing. [...]
<li>Tyreke Evans wants to be the go-to guy<br />
Evans has played well lately, averaging 21 points while shooting 54.8 percent from the field. So if the game is on the line, he wouldn&#8217;t mind having the ball. &#8220;I want to try to take on that challenge if the coach puts the ball in my hands to make a play for me or one of [...]
<li>Center Greg Monroe shining for Pistons<br />
Through 16 games, Greg Monroe is on pace to put his name among the elite centers in the NBA. Monroe is averaging 16.5 points and 9.4 rebounds. But it&#8217;s his playmaking skill that makes him different from other bigs. His 3.6 assists per game put him third among NBA centers behind the Grizzlies&#8217; Marc Gasol (4.8 entering [...]
<li>Thunder pound Rockets in James Harden return to OKC<br />
James Harden&#8217;s return to Oklahoma City was only a small part of an emotional day for the Houston Rockets. Kevin Durant matched his season high with 37 points and the Thunder beat Houston 120-98 on Wednesday night, after the Rockets made a stop in Minnesota earlier in the day to attend the funeral of coach Kevin [...]
<li>Rondo ejected in Celtics loss to Nets<br />
Doc Rivers wants the Boston Celtics to be tough - not violent. The message came too late for Rajon Rondo. The Celtics point guard was ejected from Wednesday night&#8217;s game against the Nets when he retaliated for a hard foul against Kevin Garnett by shoving Brooklyn forward Kris Humphries into the courtside seats. Rondo, Humphries and Nets [...]
<li>Streaking Hawks beat Bobcats 94-91<br />
After an atrocious 1-for-10 night at the free throw line last week, Al Horford decided to spend extra time working on his foul shots. &#8221;That&#8217;s one of the things I always work on, and I got away from it a little bit,&#8221; he said. &#8221;I think it showed when I went in that little slump.&#8221; His recent [...]
<li>Wizards beat Blazers for first win of season<br />
After their worst start in history, the Washington Wizards became a national punch line. On TNT, Charles Barkley compared them with the Washington Generals, and a local newspaper had photos of fans wearing paper bags over their heads at Monday&#8217;s 26-point loss to San Antonio. The jokes can stop - at least for now. Washington earned its [...]
<li>Jonas Jerebko demoted in Detroit<br />
Jonas Jerebko tried his best not to say much, and verbally, he succeeded. The Detroit Pistons power forward&#8217;s fiery eyes showed how he really felt about discussing his demotion this week. &#8220;You never want to sit on the bench,&#8221; Jerebko said before tonight&#8217;s game against the Phoenix Suns.  &#8221;So I&#8217;m just going to keep working on my [...]
<li>Lakers guard Steve Blake out at least another two weeks<br />

<li>Chauncey Billups returns tonight for Clippers<br />
Chauncey Billups health update: He&#8217;s back!

Billups appeared in 20 games for the Clippers last season before suffering a torn left Achilles tendon on Feb. 6 in Orlando. “We are all excited to [...]
<li>Virginia Beach unveils NBA arena plan<br />
The Virginia city that&#8217;s reportedly trying to lure the Sacramento Kings has sketched out a tentative financing plan for a new arena, including huge public subsidies. Mayor Will Sessoms of Virginia Beach, Va., told his City Council late Tuesday that the city would contribute $195 million and the state will be asked to contribute $150 million [...]
<li>Private funding holding up Timberwolves Target Center deal<br />
Six months after the Vikings stadium deal paved the way for a public/private renovation of Target Center, Minneapolis&#8217; chief negotiator says the Timberwolves and the arena&#8217;s operator still won&#8217;t say how much they will pay. The &#8220;implementation committee&#8221; for the estimated $100 million renovation of the city-owned building has already met twice. But the city&#8217;s lead [...]
<li>Too soon to tell if Darren Collison is a long-term Maverick<br />
Nobody wants Collison to be a keeper more than me. The guy has great quickness, is a good ballhandler and is fearless. Not as good a defender as the Mavericks would like. But he&#8217;s working on it. But it&#8217;s tough to say right now whether he&#8217;s the long-term solution at point guard. Mayo obviously is [...]
<li>James Harden is gone, but Thunder still rolling<br />
The Thunder have the third-most effective offense in the league thus far, even with ESPN.com&#8217;s John Hollinger tearing at the inefficiency in their starting lineup last week. &#8220;After the trade, it was come in and do your job,&#8221; Thunder coach Scott Brooks said. &#8220;We said, &#8216;This is what we need from you guys,&#8217; and they&#8217;ve done [...]
<li>Turner, Young lead 76ers past Mavericks 100-98<br />
The 76ers won again with Elton Brand having another strong game and earning a hefty paycheck from the organization. Brand just couldn&#8217;t celebrate because his effort was wasted with Dallas. Evan Turner scored 22 points and Thaddeus Young had 20 to lead Philadelphia to a 100-98 win over the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday night. Brand scored a season-high [...]
<li>Reggie Evans rebounding like crazy for Nets<br />
Reggie Evans keeps it simple, with a slogan that Nike once might&#8217;ve kicked around: Just get it. Evans doesn&#8217;t view his job as a science, or a reward for practice and technique. After grabbing 14 boards Monday against the Knicks, he couldn&#8217;t really explain why he&#8217;s rebounding at a better rate than anybody in the NBA. Evans [...]
<li>Rockets to attend Sasha McHale funeral<br />
Rockets players and coaches did not know if they could help, but were certain that they had to try, that they had to be there for Kevin McHale and his family. About 40 members of the team, coaches and staff were scheduled to fly to Minneapolis from Houston after tonight’s game against Toronto to attend the [...]
