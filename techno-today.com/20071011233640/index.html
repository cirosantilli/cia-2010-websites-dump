	<p align="justify">Well after a good long break, I am finally back hopefully with more consistency to my blogging. In this post I will cover wireless data networks and how they have evolved over the years. I was primarily driven to write this post because of lack of understanding among many bloggers about wireless WANs technology and most of the time has simply been reduced to a GSM/GPRS vs. CDMA battle which is really not the case.</p>
<p align="justify">The first drivers of wireless data networks were called 2G networks. That produced 2 mainstream network technology, GPRS and CDMA 1xRTT. GPRS is standardized by the 3GPP standards group while CDMA 1xRTT was standardized by 3GPP2 standards body. GPRS used a TDMA multiplexing scheme while CDMA 1xRTT uses a CDMA multiplexing scheme which is considered superior to the TDMA scheme because it more effectively uses the available spectrum. The downside of course there was more vendors for GPRS than CDMA therefore it costs less. Today EDGE networks which is an optimized GPRS network is predominant in many parts of the world.</p>
<p align="justify">A few years back, we starting getting into 3G networks. The 3GPP2 body standardized EVDO, a network technology also based on CDMA, while 3GPP standards body standardized a class of network technology called WCDMA (Wide-band CDMA) also based on CDMA multiplexing scheme. UMTS and HSPA are 2 main implementations of this class. HSPA is an optimized version of the UMTS technology. Today 3G networks are starting to emerge at least in many big cities around the world. There has been quite a bit of positioning among vendors that has slowered the pace of adoption. Moreover the chip sets haven&#8217;t matured enough for many vendors to adopt them. Battery life has been a huge issue so well as packaging issues.</p>
<p align="justify">Finally in a few years from now we are going to see 4G networks emerge. 4G network technology will be based on a new physical layer multiplexing scheme called OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access). You can read more about this on Wikipedia but primarily it has to do with interference canceling among orthogonal frequencies. The 3GPP standard is working towards standardizing a technology called LTE (Long Term Evolution), while 3GPP2 standard is working towards a standard called UMB (Ultra-Mobile Broadband). But, there is another technology called WiMax that also aims to chip in as a 4G technology. WiMax has become an IEEE standard.  There are two version of WiMax (1) Fixed (2) Mobile. The Fixed WiMax is used for meshing together back hauls, while Mobile WiMax is the real challenger to LTE and UMB. Mobile WiMax incorporates an implementation from WiBro in Korea and Fixed WiMax. It allows handoffs between base stations like traditional cellular networks. However, WiMax will not guarantee an QoS for users because the available bandwidth is shared among the users. So the less the number of users in the network the faster it is.</p>
<p align="justify">Lots of hype, and promotion for these standards because everyone wants a piece of the action. It&#8217;s going to be an interesting watch to see which standard becomes the predominantly used technology.</p>

	<p>June 2, 2007 | <a href="http://www.techno-today.com/?p=127#respond" title="Comment on Interfaces, Vista, and more&#8230;">Leave a Comment</a></p>
	</div>
	<p align="justify"><img align="left" src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/graphics/2007/05/30/computer2.jpg" />It&#8217;s been a while since I last blogged so I am a little bit confused as to what to cover in this post and so the confusing title. First, a lot of things have been happening on the Interface front. Microsoft had demoed a really cool technology labeled as surface computer. I expected this from someone ever since Apple set of this technology first in the embedded space with iPhone. From the demos, it looked very cool, and had some very interesting applications. How and when such a technology would be commercialized is still an open question.</p>
<p align="justify">I have been using Vista for the last month or so. It&#8217;s been an interesting experience. Overall, some improvements over Windows XP, but I would say its really not worth the cost. The things I liked the most include the side bar feature (similar to Google side bar), Windows Media Player 11 and IE. Calendar and Mail applications, which I expected a lot from, were real disappointments. Most application worked well except Visual Studio 2003, which from MSDN I found out will no longer be supported. Some of the other applications I use like VLC player were considerable more buggy than on XP. I ended up turning off Windows Defender, and User Accounts Control. Both of these were irritating to say the least. WMP 11 is much more usable than its predecessor. Internet settings were improved. Aero was also a disappointment. It&#8217;s a good interface but had no wow factor to it. The OS itself is buggy to some extent. So considering most of the improvements and applications are ported back to XP, I would say its probably not worth upgrading at least until the next service pack.</p>

	</div>
	<p align="justify">Google hasn&#8217;t released a killer application since Google Maps. But one thing they have going these days is integration between their various online services. Google has reached a level of integration of its products and services like no other company has. Google Search now integrates several services like Notebook, Calendar, Finance, and Maps. It&#8217;s wonderful to see many different applications working together in a seamless and scalable fashion. I think this is a very important point for all companies to learn from.</p>
<p align="justify">This also reminded me of a talk a year back at the Wireless Enterprise Symposium (WES) by IBM&#8217;s Lotus President, where he noted that this integration would be the future and adopting open standards is the primary driver of this. So those who are predicting the end of open standards like HTML/Java Script/AJAX (partly because of upcoming sand boxing frameworks like FLEX, Sliver light, and JavaFX) are very likely to be wrong.</p>
<p align="justify">Update: Google has decided to advertise this integration in what they term as &#8220;Universal Search&#8221;. While it similar to Amazon&#8217;s A9 search, coming from Google is a big thing. From what I can see is that they have integrated almost all their services (including image and blog search) into it. What would be interesting to see is if Google can scale their search times in spite of these additional overheads. I would think they will employ a technique similar to those in maps where the request from these different servers come asynchronously to the user and Java script on the client would render them appropriately. The disadvantage of using this strategy is some older browsers and mobile browsers might not be compatible. Google might chose to employ a fall back default mechanism to handle this like how they do so for Gmail.</p>

	</div>
	<p align="justify">I wanted to write about this topic for a long time but somehow it got postponed. I have rated CEO(s) based on mainly their performance, and vision. Perhaps, the focus was more on the latter since that&#8217;s what distinguishes them from the rest.</p>
<p align="justify">1. Steve Jobs (Apple) - Arguably the face of Apple. Since he was rehired by Apple, he has taken the company from strength to strength. He has made Apple &#8216;cool&#8217; again with the introduction of products like Mac Mini, iPod, and iPhone. What&#8217;s so great about Steve Job is that he has not only made Apple competitive in the PC business, but extended its influence to other fields in the electronic industry. His customary yearly speeches have been an interesting watch, so much so that the iPhone announcement completely overshadowed CES in January this year.</p>
<p align="justify">2. Eric Schmidt (Google) - A former Novell employee, he has made Google a leader online search. Google is a cash cow like Microsoft in Internet search. He has also successfully transformed Google&#8217;s strength in online search into other services like email, IM etc. Google is now a complete player in the Internet service business. It also has a huge lead over Microsoft and Yahoo! in important web 2.0 services like online video and online office applications.</p>
<p align="justify">3. Mark Hurd (HP) - Perhaps the least know personality in the list. It&#8217;s probably more to do with the fact that he is not as media savvy as others. But make no mistake about it, he is an absolutely a brilliant leader. He took over HP when in was in severe crisis and completely transformed it. He got rid of certain business that didn&#8217;t make money. He also fixed HP&#8217;s PC business. He has made HP the company with the largest revenue in the technology industry.</p>
<p align="justify">4. Larry Ellison (Oracle) - He is quite a personality and a brilliant CEO. He has transformed Oracle from being just a database player to a complete back office application provider. He is giving SAP a run for its money in the back office application space. His recent purchases of competitors has signaled clearly to SAP that they need to watch out for Oracle.</p>
<p align="justify">5. Paul Otellini (Intel) - If it wasn&#8217;t for the last few quarters he wouldn&#8217;t have made my list. But full kudos to Paul Otellini, who has once again put Intel into the lead. The introduction of the Core architecture microprocessor has dented AMD&#8217;s hopes to continuing to take market share from Intel. Intel is now profitable and has a significant technology lead over AMD.</p>
