Pop fan Guy Lawrence 21 felt dance-music nirvana when he heard Joy Orbison's 2009 dubstep head-fuck "Hyph Mngo" With brother Howard 18 he's heir to the tradition of the Chemical Brothers Basement Jaxx and Daft Punk marquee EDM duos as devoted to vocal-driven songcraft as they are to beatmaking The

Up from the indie minors Florida's Surfer Blood fill their second full-length with insistent jangle Anglophile emoting and hangdog melodies that suggest collegiate mope rock might never go away Producer Gil Norton smooths the foursome's edges while interjecting horror-comic backup yelps that marked his Pixies work decades ago; little else

Jimmy Eat World were the schoolboy innocents of the mid-Nineties emo scene plying lively down-the-middle tunes applicable to smooching teens of any era Twenty years later on their first album since 2010 the Arizona guys still sound sweet They're also hall-monitor dull &ndash; these meat and potatoes sure could use

Recorded while he dog-sat for his aunt and uncle this London producer's debut compacted the big sounds of techno hip-hop and ambient into music so transfixing it could make a walk around the block seem like an adventure The pace of his second LP is quicker but the style is
<li><a href='http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-wack-album-20130607' target="_blank">The Wack Album</a><br />
Last time out the Lonely Island made a classic joke-rap album while somehow persuading Michael Bolton to belt "This whole town's a pussy just waiting to get fucked!" Their third LP isn't as sublimely silly or as consistent but it rocks the same mix of guest stars (T-Pain Robyn) sophisticated

Is there a more debonair dirtball in rock than Josh Homme? The Queens of the Stone Age frontman is the high priest of grimy rock tradition exalting in exquisitely wrought guitar scraping and wry machismo &ndash; whether with his main gig or in side bands like the Dave Grohl collaboration
<li><a href='http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/personal-record-20130604' target="_blank">Personal Record</a><br />
Listening to the classic-rock jigsaw puzzles Eleanor Friedberger and her brother Matthew create in the Fiery Furnaces can be difficult work As a solo artist she's more approachable Her second LP is full of crisp jangly indie pop that can suggest Harry Nilsson or a bookish early Stones and it's
<li><a href='http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/avalanche-20130604' target="_blank">Avalanche</a><br />
Producer-musician Robin Hannibal is having a killer year in large part due to his great taste in singers The follow-up to Rhye (his collaboration with gender-bending vocalist Mike Milosh) is the second album of new material from the project with his Danish homegirl Coco Maja Hastrup Karshøj aka Coco O

"We decided to write horror music" is how Ozzy Osbourne describes Black Sabbath's birth in the great new heavy-metal oral history Louder Than Hell And that's exactly what they're doing once again on 13 &ndash; a reunion set with three-quarters of the original band &ndash; that revisits and to an

"I can give a fuck about the IV Play/I want it now" The-Dream sings on his fifth album The Atlanta singer-songwriter's romantic poetry makes Prince look like Art Garfunkel But if his booty-poppin' subject matter isn't original the kaleidoscope R&B butter-storms he cooks up give his sexcapades a hallucinatory drama
<li><a href='http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/wings-over-america-deluxe-edition-20130528' target="_blank">Wings Over America [Deluxe Edition]</a><br />
Wings Over America was Paul McCartney&rsquo;s bold arena-rock (as opposed to pop) move of the 1970s &ndash; a triple-disc live set complete with vocal showcases for the backup guys It was also the first time he remade Beatles oldies &ndash; &ldquo;Blackbird&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bluebird&rdquo; fit together well There&rsquo;s something daft and

"It ain't me babe" sings Laura Marling in "Master Hunter" echoing Dylan for her own back-the-fuck-off-my-love song Since her days singing folk pop with the Mumford & Sons clan she's followed her own muse to more-interesting places Her fourth LP begins with seven songs linked by drones lyric shards and

"I'm leaving you/I'm goin' home" sings Jenny Lewis on "Let Me Back In" a kiss off with tap-dance percussion that doubles as love song to Los Angeles and triples as a belated farewell to a band that was putting post-Elliott Smith LA indie-pop on the map back when Best Coast's
<li><a href='http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/spirit-in-the-room-20130521' target="_blank">Spirit In The Room</a><br />

Nothing gets to French Montana The Moroccan-American MC has scored a string of hits on the strength of his luxuriously unhurried flow slinging street dreams in the cadences of a sleepy don The beats on his major-label debut range from bleak to triumphal to jackhammer-manic; none of it seems to

The title of Demi Lovato's fourth LP promises a "personal" album and Lovato gets songwriting credits on nine songs But make no mistake This is industrial-strength pop and all the better for it The songwriters include hitmaking heavyweights like Ryan Tedder and Rami Yacoub; the choruses boom; the production has

After detours including a Grammy-winning gospel LP and a key role in boyfriend Robert Plant's Band of Joy project Griffin is back to her day job singing her own artful country-folk songs Except here with a voice evidently stretched by her side projects she expands the notion of country Her
