Eight people walked off the aircraft and one person was carried off on a stretcher.</p><p></p><p>A coastguard spokesman said they received a distress call at about 7pm. The helicopter's life rafts were found empty and some wreckage from the aircraft has started to wash up at the southern end of Sumburgh.</p><p></p><p>"There were 18 people on board and 15 have been recovered, there is still an ongoing search and rescue mission for the three missing people," a spokeswoman said. The 15 people were taken to Gilbert Bain hospital in Lerwick.</p><p></p><p>"The people that were involved are in varying stages of injury, no one has walked away from this without a scratch."</p><p></p><p>The helicopter was on approach to Sumburgh Airport when it went down. The airport has been closed so that emergency services can deal with the incident.</p><p></p><p>The Super Puma helicopter was operated by helicopter services company CHC and was taking people to and from oil and gas platforms in the North Sea.</p><p></p><p>"We can confirm that an L2 aircraft has landed in the water, approximately two miles west of Sumburgh," a statement from the company said.</p><p></p><p>"The aircraft was on approach to Sumburgh Airport at approximately 6.20pm when contact was lost with air traffic control.</p><p></p><p>"We can confirm there were 16 passengers on board, and two crew."</p><p></p><p>Investigators from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch were travelling to the scene this evening.</p><p></p><p>A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: "The AAIB is aware of the incident and has deployed a team".</p><p></p><p>A Northlink ferry which was travelling between Shetland and Aberdeen has been diverted to the scene.</p><p></p><p>Last year, two helicopters ditched in the North Sea only six months apart.

This says that police can only detain an individual at ports and airports to assess whether they have "been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism".</p><p>Clegg contrasted the police action with the way in which the government negotiated with the Guardian to destroy hard drives containing NSA documents leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p><p>Clegg wrote: "I was not consulted on the plans to detain David Miranda before it happened and I acknowledge the many concerns raised about the use of Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for these purposes.</p><p>"There is obviously a material difference between agreeing by mutual consent that files will be destroyed, and forcibly detaining someone.</p><p>"Terrorism powers should be used proportionately. That is why it is immensely important that the independent reviewer of terrorism powers, David Anderson QC, reports rapidly on whether this was a legitimate use of the Terrorism Act, and whether that legislation should be adjusted."</p><p>Anderson, who is to question Home Office officials who briefed May on the plan to detain Miranda during his short inquiry, called this week for changes to the Terrorism Act. May has ruled out any further changes beyond those proposed before the detention of Miranda.</p><p>Clegg wrote: "This autumn we will be taking a bill through parliament to implement these changes [announced before the detention of Miranda]. In my view, if David Anderson provides a clearly justified recommendation to restrict these powers even further, we should seek to do so in this bill."</p><p>In his article Clegg confirmed that in its negotiations with the government the Guardian made its own decisions about whether to publish information from the leaked NSA documents which could damage national security. "Along with the information the newspaper had published, they had information which put national security and lives at risk. It was right for us to want that information destroyed. They had decided not to publish this information: not a single sentence was censored from their newspaper as a result of the information being destroyed."</p><p>Clegg used his article to dismiss a claim by William Hague, in the wake of the first revelations in June from the leaked NSA documents, that law-abiding citizens have "nothing to fear" about monitoring by intelligence agencies. The deputy prime minister wrote: "Liberal Democrats believe government must tread the fine line between liberty and security very carefully, and are not easily persuaded by a government minister asserting: 'Just trust me.'"</p><p>He was also scathing about Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, who had raised questions about the detention of Miranda.</p><p>He wrote: "People are right to ask questions about the detention of David Miranda for nine hours this week. But Yvette Cooper voted for powers to detain suspects for 90 days ? 2,160 hours. Her outrage is almost comic."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/terrorism">Counter-terrorism policy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uksecurity">UK security and counter-terrorism</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/david-miranda">David Miranda</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nickclegg">Nick Clegg</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition">Liberal-Conservative coalition</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives">Conservatives</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats">Liberal Democrats</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/police">Police</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/metropolitan-police">Metropolitan police</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicholaswatt">Nicholas Watt</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In 2012 we published research which showed that half of all girls (51%) are put off physical activity by their experiences of school sport and PE, despite three-quarters (74%) of girls saying they'd like to be more active. The UCL finding that just 38% of girls are getting the recommended amount of exercise has worrying implications for the future health of girls and women in the UK, and raises disturbing questions about the impact of the Olympic legacy.</p><p>Physical inactivity among girls is associated with a range of outcomes from obesity and low self-esteem to poor educational attainment. With school sport playing a key role in shaping attitudes to health and fitness, it's crucial that we get this right. The biggest challenge is to ensure that every child is fit and active, and we call on the government to make sure that girls (and boys) have the opportunity to try as many different sports and ways to be active as possible. <br /><strong>Sue Tibballs</strong><br /><em>Chief executive, Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation</em></p><p></p><p>? The news that half of all seven-year-olds exercise less than the recommended hour per day confirms that children spend too long at screens and not long enough outdoors. I agree with Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation, who last week recommended a return to an "outdoors childhood" as a way to combat rising childhood obesity and poor general health. Kids who spend time playing outdoors are happier and healthier.</p><p>Having interviewed over 100 families over the past three years making <a href="http://www.projectwildthing.com/" title="">Project Wild Thing</a>, a documentary about children's failing connection to nature, I believe the big question is what we can do to ensure children spend more time outside. The evidence is now overwhelming that an indoor existence damages children and society. Are we prepared to limit traffic, tone down shrill news about stranger danger, relax health and safety regulations, and open up the countryside to families? If not, we should expect to produce more sickly, unhappy children.<br /><strong>David Bond</strong><br /><em>London</em></p><p></p><p>? There is no doubt that physical activity has the potential to bring a wide range of health benefits. Liam Donaldson the former chief medical officer, went so far as to say if there was such a medication it would be regarded as a wonder drug. However, your subheadline makes a misleading link to obesity, which is far less clear. The key determinant in obesity is diet, and it would have been more powerful to make the connection with Gove's antipathy to improving school meals and the government's pathological fear of regulating the food industry. Taken together, diet and physical activity have the potential to save many lives and billions of pounds.<br /><strong>Neil Blackshaw</strong><br /><em>Little Easton, Essex</em></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/children">Children</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gender">Gender</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/youngpeople">Young people</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity">Obesity</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/health">Health</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing">Health & wellbeing</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/health">Health policy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/policy">Public services policy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove">Michael Gove</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He said: "When you try to achieve great scale with automation and the automation exceeds the boundaries of human oversight there is going to be failure. That goes for governments, for consumer companies, for Google, or a big insurance company.</p><p>"It is infuriating because it is driven by unreasonable greed. In many cases the systems that tend to fail, fail because of an attempt to make them run automatically with a minimal amount of human oversight."</p><p>The Nasdaq collapse was caused by a communication failure between its platform for processing quotes and trades and that of another party ? reportedly the New York Stock Exchange. So serious was the fallout that it resulted in a third fewer shares being traded in the United States on that day.</p><p>"These outages are absolutely going to continue," said Neil MacDonald, a fellow at technology research firm Gartner. "There has been an explosion in data across all types of enterprises. The complexity of the systems created to suppport big data is beyond the understanding of a single person and they also fail in ways that are beyond the comprehension of a single person."</p><p>From high volume securities trading to the explosion in social media and the online consumption of entertainment, the amount of data being carried globally over the private networks, such as stock exchanges, and the public internet is placing unprecedented strain both on websites and on the networks that connect them.</p><p>By 2017, an amount of data equivalent to all the films ever produced will be transmitted over the internet in a three-minute period, according to Cisco, a manufacturer of communications equipment.</p><p>Internet traffic today per person is measured in gigabytes, with six gigabytes of information exchanged per human per year. In 2017, that number will have risen to 16. By then, global data will be counted in zettabytes ? roughly one trillion gigabytes.</p><p>High frequency trading by computers built to automate buying and selling high volumes of shares by hedge funds and banks has triggered and magnified the impact of IT failures on stockmarkets. In May 2010, $862bn was erased from the value of US shares in 20 minutes when one company triggered a cascade of selling.</p><p>"You get under the covers and high frequency trading algorithms are beyond understanding," said MacDonald. "Sub-millisecond trades taking place, tens of thousands per second, and when that fails it fails spectacularly. That is what you are seeing manifested in Nasdaq."</p><p>This month's spate of outages came to international attention with the two-hour failure of the New York Times website on 14 August, during which it resorted to publishing articles from its Facebook page. While a malicious attack was initially suspected, the problem was caused simply by a scheduled system maintenance.</p><p>On the same day, Microsoft customers began to report email failures. The outage was traced to problems with the Exchange ActiveSync service which serves email to many of the world's smartphones. When Exchange hit a glitch, the sheer volume of phones trying to connect triggered a ripple effect that took three days to control.</p><p>On 16 August, many of Google's websites, from email to YouTube to its core search engine, suffered a rare four-minute global meltdown. The episode, whose cause Google has not explained publicly, served to illustrate the sheer volume of traffic its servers process. During its outage, one monitor put the drop in global internet traffic at 40%.</p><p>Three days later, on 19 August, Amazon was hit. The company's North American retail site went down for an estimated 49 minutes, with visitors greeted with the word "Oops". No explanation was given, but one estimate by Forbes but the cost to Amazon at nearly $2m in lost sales.</p><p>On 22 August, Apple's iCloud suffered a blackout that affected a small number of its customers but lasted 11 hours. Storing the collections of photos, music, documents and address books we would once have kept on our shelves at home, iCloud now has 300 million users.</p><p>"The volume of data overall is absolutely exploding," says Rachel Dines, senior analyst at Forrester. "This week has been especially bad for downtime. Because we are now so dependent on these high profile services we notice them more. The impacts for the companies are huge from both lost revenue but also more importantly reputation damage."</p><p>As well as selling books and music, Amazon is the largest provider of public digital storage space worldwide, and this side of the business was hit in 2012 during upgrades designed to make its servers less likely to collapse.</p><p>"The outage at Amazon last year was traced back to some of the processes and technologies they had put in place to make it more resilient," said MacDonald. "It is almost like an auto-immune disease, where the systems they created to make it more resilient actually spread the failure more rapidly."</p><p>Lanier, whose Who Owns The Future? details the concentration of power among organisations with the largest computers, said outages would increase until human oversight was improved. "We don't yet have a design for society that can run this technology well. We haven't figured out what the right human roles should be."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet">Internet</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/computing">Computing</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/nasdaq">Nasdaq</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets">Stock markets</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google">Google</a></li><li><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/microsoft/">Microsoft</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon">Amazon.com</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/juliette-garside">Juliette Garside</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He said it was designed to "retrieve or destroy classified information".</p><p>The <a href="http://gu.com/p/3t99v" title="">remarks by Clegg, in an article</a> in which he made no link between Miranda and terrorism, will raise new questions about whether the Met acted lawfully in detaining the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. This says that police can only detain an individual at ports and airports to assess whether they have "been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism".</p><p>Clegg contrasted the police action with the way in which the government negotiated with the Guardian to destroy hard drives containing NSA documents leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p><p>Clegg wrote: "The intent behind detaining David Miranda was the same [as the government's negotiations with the Guardian]: to retrieve or destroy classified information. I was not consulted on the plans to detain him before it happened, however, and I acknowledge the many concerns raised about the use of schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 for these purposes.</p><p>"There is obviously a material difference between agreeing by mutual consent that files will be destroyed, and forcibly detaining someone. Terrorism powers should be used proportionately. That is why it is immensely important that the independent reviewer of terrorism powers, David Anderson QC, reports rapidly on whether this was a legitimate use of the Terrorism Act, and whether that legislation should be adjusted."</p><p>Anderson, who is to question Home Office officials who briefed May on the plan to detain Miranda during his short inquiry, called this week for a changes to the Terrorism Act. May has ruled out any further changes beyond those proposed before the detention of Miranda.</p><p>Clegg wrote: "This autumn we will be taking a bill through parliament to implement these changes [announced before the detention of Miranda]. In my view, if David Anderson provides a clearly justified recommendation to restrict these powers even further, we should seek to do so in this bill."</p><p>In his article Clegg confirmed that in its negotiations with the government the Guardian made its own decisions about whether to publish information from the leaked NSA documents which could damage national security. "Along with the information the newspaper had published, they had information which put national security and lives at risk. It was right for us to want that information destroyed. They had decided not to publish this information: not a single sentence was censored from their newspaper as a result of the information being destroyed."</p><p>Clegg used his article to dismiss a claim by William Hague, in the wake of the first revelations in June from the leaked NSA documents, that law-abiding citizens have "nothing to fear" about monitoring by intelligence agencies. The deputy prime minister wrote: "Liberal Democrats believe government must tread the fine line between liberty and security very carefully, and are not easily persuaded by a government minister asserting: 'Just trust me.'"</p><p>He was also scathing about Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, who had raised questions about the detention of Miranda. He wrote: "People are right to ask questions about the detention of David Miranda for nine hours this week. But Yvette Cooper voted for powers to detain suspects for 90 days ? 2,160 hours. Her outrage is almost comic."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/terrorism">Counter-terrorism policy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uksecurity">UK security and counter-terrorism</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nickclegg">Nick Clegg</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/metropolitan-police">Metropolitan police</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/david-miranda">David Miranda</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/police">Police</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition">Liberal-Conservative coalition</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives">Conservatives</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats">Liberal Democrats</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/nicholaswatt">Nicholas Watt</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He died in 1987, and is sometimes forgotten in civil rights history<br /><br />? <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/21/march-on-washington-share-your-stories">What does the US civil rights movement mean to you</a>?</p><p>When civil rights leaders met at the Roosevelt Hotel in Harlem in early July 1963 to hammer out the ground rules by which they would work together to organise the March on Washington there was really only one main sticking point: <a href="http://rustin.org/">Bayard Rustin</a>. </p><p>Rustin, a formidable organiser and central figure in the civil rights movement, was a complex and compelling figure. Raised a Quaker, his political development would take him through pacifism, communism, socialism and into the civil rights movement in dramatic fashion. In 1944, after refusing to fight in World War Two, he had been jailed as a conscientious objector. It was primarily through him that the leadership would adopt non-violent direct action not only as a strategy but a principle. "The only weapons we have is our bodies," he once said. "And we have to tuck them in places so wheels don't turn."</p><p>Rustin was also openly gay, an attribute which was regarded as a liability in the early sixties in a movement dominated by clerics. His position became particularly vulnerable following his arrest in Pasadena, in 1953, when he was caught having sex with two men in a parked car. Charged with lewd vagrancy he plead out to a lesser 'morals charge' and was sent to jail for 60 days.</p><p>Some in the room that day believed all this made him too great a liability to be associated with such a high profile event. Roy Wilkins of the NAACP, was candid. "I don't want you leading that march on Washington, because you know I don't give a damn about what they say, but publicly I don't want to have to defend the draft dodging," he said. "I know you're a Quaker, but that's not what I'll have to defend. I'll have to defend draft dodging. I'll have to defend promiscuity. The question is never going to be homosexuality, it's going to be promiscuity and I can't defend that. And the fact is that you were a member of the Young Communist League. And I don't care what you say, I can't defend that."</p><p>Wilkins did not get his way. Rustin would lead the march and do so brilliantly while Wilkins would be called upon to defend him and do so. Fifty years on the White House has announced that Bayard Rustin will be <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/08/president-obama-names-presidential-medal-freedom-recipients">posthumously awarded</a> the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. The award marks the <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2013/8/12/black_gay_and_a_pacifist_bayard">end of a journey</a> for Rustin, who died in 1987: from marginalisation in both life and history to mainstream official accolade just in time for the 50th anniversary of arguably his crowning achievement ? organising the march on Washington.</p><p>By the time the march was proposed, writes John D'Emilio, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lost-Prophet-Times-Bayard-Rustin/dp/0226142698">Lost Prophet: The Life and Times of Bayard Rustin</a>: "He had recently turned 50. He was still waiting for his day in the limelight, though likely believing it would never come. Prejudice of another sort, still not named as such in mid-century America, had curtailed his opportunities and limited his effectiveness."</p><p>With a vertical mop of salt-and-pepper hair and his tie hung loose on his chest, Rustin always cut a distinctive figure. The idea for a march on Washington had been hatched by his long term mentor, A Philip Randolph, who was 20 years his senior. But there had been few takers from the civil rights movement for a national march until demonstrations erupted in Birmingham in Spring. </p><p>Demonstrations in Washington DC are now a common occurrence but what Randolph and Rustin were proposing was audacious ? 100,000 protesters descending on the Capitol ? unprecedented.</p><p>The following eight weeks, writes D'Emilio, "were the busiest in Rustin's life. He had to build an organization out of nothing. He had to assemble a staff and shape them into a team able to perform under intense pressure. He had to craft a coalition that would hang together despite organizational competition, personal animosities and often antagonistic politics. He had to manoeuvre through the mine field of an opposition that ranged from liberals who were counselling moderation to segregationists out to sabotage the event. And he had to do all of this while staying enough out of the public eye so that the liabilities he carried would not undermine his work."</p><p>The headquarters for this extraordinary endeavour was a rented, run down former church on West 130th Street and Lenox Avenue in Harlem. The building soon resembled a cross between a student union in occupation and a military headquarters on high alert. "It was very <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Speech-Behind-Martin-Luther/dp/1608463222">exciting and frenetic</a>," says Rachelle Horowitz, the march's transport chief who was also Rustin's long-time assistant. "It ran on adrenalin and excitement with everybody working from early in the morning 'til late into the night. It was very collegial, very primitive and very egalitarian." </p><p>As such it was a tribute to Rustin's eccentric, hyperactive, and efficient personality. He was in constant motion, interrupting conversations to answer phones even as he passed notes to staff, doodled and chain-smoked. "I had had many differences with Bayard in the past and was destined to have more differences with him in the future," recalled the late civil rights leader James Farmer in his autobiography. "But I must say that I have never seen such a difficult task of coordination performed with more skill and deftness."</p><p>Throughout that time as the coalition supporting the march grew, so the nature of the March would change, diluting it of much of its more militant elements even as the prospective size was bolstered. As Rustin announced the abandonment of each new aspect, his young staff would berate him, partly in jest, partly in frustration. "We'd shout: 'Oh Bayard, you're turning it into a circus!'" Horowitz told me with a laugh. </p><p>Ever the coalition builder, Rustin explained: "What you have to understand is that the march will succeed if it gets 100,000 people ? or 150,000 or 200,000 or more ? to show up in Washington. It will be the biggest rally in history. It will show the Black community united as never before ? united also with whites from labor and the churches, from all over the country." 250,000 people would ultimately be there.</p><p>It was precisely this ability to see the big picture while keeping an eye on details like the number of toilets necessary and the kind of sandwiches people should pack (they advised against using mayonnaise since the heat could spoil it and cause diarrhea) that encouraged Randolph to defend him that day against Wilkin's attacks.</p><p>For while Wilkins' manner may have been abrasive, his concerns were routine at the time. Shortly before he died, Farmer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1578064880/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1376941020&sr=1-1&keywords=gary+younge+no+place+like+home">explained to me</a> how he vetted people for the Freedom Rides in 1961. "We had to screen them very carefully because we knew that if they found anything to throw at us, they would throw it. We checked for Communists, homosexuals, drug addicts. They had to be 21 or over, and have the approval of their parents. I personally interviewed people, and then would talk to their friends." </p><p>When Randolph insisted on Rustin, Wilkins retorted: "You can take that on if you want. But don't expect me to do anything about it when the trouble starts."</p><p>The trouble came to a head less than a month before the march when segregationist senator Strom Thurmond took to the Senate floor to brand Rustin a "Communist, draft-dodger and homosexual," entering into the congressional record a picture of Rustin talking to King while King was in a bathtub. But the attack came too late and from too poisoned a well to have any impact beyond rallying support for Rustin even from Wilkins. "I'm sure there were some homophobes in the movement," said activist Eleanor Holmes. "But you knew how to behave when Strom Thurmond attacked."</p><p>History turned out to be kinder to Rustin than it was to Thurmond. On Thurmond's death it transpired that the whole time he was railing against integration he had a black daughter by a family maid. Rustin, meanwhile, will now be honoured at a time when <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/07/gay-marriage-optimism-activists">gay equality has majority support</a> by a black president in his second term. </p><p>"We are a people," wrote Alice Walker in her essay, <a href="http://www.stlucieco.gov/zora/zora_marker_4.htm">Zora Neale Hurston: a Cautionary Tale and a Partisan View</a>. "A people do not throw their geniuses away. And if they are thrown away, it is our duty as artists and as witnesses for the future to collect them again for the sake of our children and, if necessary, bone by bone."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/race">Race issues</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa">United States</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gay-rights">Gay rights</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/washington-dc">Washington DC</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/religion">Religion</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/martin-luther-king">Martin Luther King</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/garyyounge">Gary Younge</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

If changes to the Terrorism Act are recommended, we will seek to implement them</p><p>The events of last week <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/david-miranda" title="">involving the Guardian and its reporters</a> have renewed debate and inflamed concern about the age-old dilemma of how to strike the balance between individual liberty and collective security. The coalition made freedom one of its founding principles back in 2010 and many people are looking to us now to prove we meant it.</p><p>Liberal Democrats believe government must tread the fine line between liberty and security very carefully, and are not easily persuaded by a government minister asserting: "Just trust me." So now that we are in government, we have been vigilant in ensuring the right decisions are made: scrutinising and challenging the assumptions of security experts, even as we give them our wholehearted support in their aim to keep the public safe.</p><p>You may remember the ferocious debate earlier this year between me and the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/25/snoopers-charter-nick-clegg-agreement" title="">Conservatives on plans to introduce a "snooper's charter"</a>, keeping records of everyone's email and internet activity. We looked at the details time and again, and agreed to tackle the issue of how we track IP addresses, but the plan as a whole was a bridge too far.</p><p>One point on which both parties have been united is this: seeking to unpick the worst excesses of Labour's authoritarian legislation. From restoring rights to protest, ending the detention of children in immigration cases, scrapping ID cards and limiting some terrorism powers, we have turned the clock back on their biggest mistakes. It has been bizarre to see Yvette Cooper parrot concerns about civil liberties while representing a party hard-wired to trample on those liberties while in office. People are right to ask questions about the detention of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/david-miranda-court-victory-data-police" title="">David Miranda</a> for nine hours this week. But Cooper voted for powers to detain suspects for 90 days ? 2,160 hours. Her outrage is almost comical.</p><p>Let me address directly the two specific decisions that have confronted the government this week. I believed at the time, and still do, that it was entirely reasonable for the government to seek to get leaked documents back from the Guardian or have them destroyed. Along with the information the newspaper had published, it had information that put national security and lives at risk. It was right for us to want that information destroyed. The Guardian had decided not to publish this information: not a single sentence was censored from the newspaper as a result of the information being destroyed.</p><p>I was not consulted on the plans to detain him before it happened, and I acknowledge the many concerns raised about the use of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2011/may/26/terrorism-act-schedule-7" title="">schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000</a> for these purposes. There is obviously a material difference between agreeing by mutual consent that files will be destroyed, and forcibly detaining someone. Terrorism powers should be used proportionately. That is why it is immensely important that the independent reviewer of terrorism powers, David Anderson QC, reports rapidly on whether this was a legitimate use of the Terrorism Act, and whether that legislation should be adjusted. Already, we are planning to limit the schedule 7 powers. We consulted last year on a wide set of improvements ? such as reducing the maximum period of detention to six hours and allowing anyone detained for more than 60 minutes access to a lawyer. This autumn we will be taking a bill through parliament to implement these changes. In my view, if Anderson provides a clearly justified recommendation to restrict these powers even further, we should seek to do so in this bill.</p><p>There is a wider question, however, about this expanding world of data and information sharing. The power of information technology hasn't just transformed our daily lives, it has shifted the very boundaries of this ancient debate about liberty and security. These new technologies have extraordinary liberating potential but also pose new challenges and threats.</p><p>Criminals and terrorists now have access to a dizzying array of information, with devastating implications, while the security authorities have new tools with which to track them down. Data-mining techniques have the capacity to make government much more efficient but pose a real risk to personal privacy if taken too far. Social media can create new communities that would never have been possible before, but can also be the source of tragedy, as we have seen in a series of recent young suicides.</p><p>So a balance must be struck between a libertarian "anything goes" approach, which sees new technology as a way to escape from the reach of the law, and an authoritarian view that sees technology as a new opportunity to intrude into our lives. Technology will continue to evolve and governments worldwide will try to evolve with it. As long as Liberal Democrats are in government, I will ensure that our individual rights are not cast aside in the name of collective security.</p><p>?

As Chelsea Manning begins her sentence, Paris Lees recounts her experience of being trans behind bars</p><p>It turns out that they do, in fact, send people like me to prison. My friends and family assured me this wasn't so during the terrifying months leading up to my trial for robbery. Today I'm a transgender woman, but back then I was seen as a&nbsp;dangly gay boy. I'd known I was a girl since I was four, if you'll excuse the cliche, but everyone told me I&nbsp;couldn't be, because of&nbsp;a pesky penis between my legs. Puberty hit and I&nbsp;assumed I was gay. I liked boys, so what else could I call myself? I used to wear makeup and "girls' clothes" (whatever that means) because it made me happy. I supposed I&nbsp;was one of those boys who enjoyed dressing up. There are plenty of them.</p><p>It didn't feel like dressing up, though; it felt more profound than that. But how to explore that nagging feeling of being in the wrong body with the threat of prison hanging over me, too? Turn up at court wearing a suit if you want a lenient sentence, I knew that. Not that it did me any good. I borrowed a tie and got two years.</p><p>Miscarriages of justice aside, you don't end up in prison unless you've made some bad decisions. Mine was taking part in a robbery. I was 16 at the time and 18 when they locked me&nbsp;up. As you might expect, looking like a girly boy in an institute full of rough lads wasn't a barrel of&nbsp;laughs. Think Tootsie meets Scum. But prison isn't meant to be fun, is it? I got picked on, sometimes ? generally by new boys, stereotypical meat-heads who questioned my friends for "talking to that poof". It didn't happen often, though, as I&nbsp;was lucky enough to be on&nbsp;a wing for vulnerable prisoners. There wasn't much fighting but there were plenty of blood-stained sheets (and inmates) pulled out of cells after unsuccessful suicide attempts. There were successful attempts, too. Overall the boys on my wing hurt themselves, not other people, and I&nbsp;experienced more violence for being "poofy" at school than I ever did inside. I was bullied violently throughout school.</p><p>I felt divorced from myself in prison. I saw a boy who'd done stupid things and found himself in a dark place. That wasn't me, was it? I knew who I wanted to be: someone with qualifications, who didn't smoke, who ate better, who had better friends ? ones that didn't turn up in the middle of the night with decent drugs and bad ideas ? and someone who had&nbsp;managed to make that seemingly magical transition from male to female. But I doubted I could become that person. My self-esteem was crushed, back then, crouching down at the bottom of society. My dreams seemed too grand. Still, life doesn't end at 18. I knew I could try to&nbsp;change. I had nothing to lose. It was worth a go.</p><p>I had art therapy sessions, in which I&nbsp;produced crude impressions of my imagined female self. There was performance art, too, but that was a private exhibition. In my cell at night I plucked my eyebrows with my fingernails. I&nbsp;shaved daily. There's no laser hair-removal in prison. I shaved my armpits and,&nbsp;sometimes, my legs. I stole coloured chalk and ground it into crude&nbsp;makeup. I grew my hair.</p><p>Gender dysphoria is a recognised medical condition, but prisoners with&nbsp;gender issues struggle to access appropriate support. In a civil society we might remove criminals' freedom, but not their healthcare. I hope Chelsea Manning gets the help she needs.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/chelsea-manning">Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning)</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/transgender">Transgender</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/prisons-and-probation">Prisons and probation</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa">United States</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-politics">US politics</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/criminal-justice">UK criminal justice</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paris-lees">Paris Lees</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

How difficult is life for transgender people behind bars?</p><p>In July last year a prisoner serving a discretionary life sentence for sexual offences was found hanged at Full Sutton, a maximum security men's jail near York. In the months leading up to the hanging, William "Billie" Evans had been wearing women's clothing and makeup as he became she. Evans was in the process of transitioning into a woman when she died.</p><p>An inquest has not yet been held into the 44-year-old's death, though a prisoner at the jail told the Guardian she had been subjected to intense bullying and had been moved to a supposedly safer wing of the jail when she was found hanging in her single cell.</p><p>But we don't need a coroner to confirm that male prisons are pretty macho places, where bullying is rife. Gyms are the most popular recreational facility, and are usually packed with inmates bent on bulking up their already honed torsos. For gay men, prison presents a challenge: abuse is commonplace, and gay men usually develop a thick skin and a readiness to meet mockery head-on. But those trapped in the wrong gender and undergoing change face an entirely different order of challenge.</p><p>After Bradley Manning was jailed for 35 years this week for leaking a cache of US government secrets, his lawyer, David Coombs, announced that his client wished to be called Chelsea Manning and addressed with the female pronoun. Coombs said Manning was seeking hormone therapy and not a&nbsp;sex-change operation.</p><p>Some jurisdictions in the US now require facilities to provide hormone therapy to trans inmates as a&nbsp;part of their routine medical care, but Fort Leavenworth, the military installation where Manning is being held, is not currently compelled to do the same. Officials there have made it clear that they will not be providing the required treatment, beyond psychiatric support.</p><p>No inmates have received sex-reassignment surgery while in US prisons, Jennifer Levi, director of the Transgender Rights Project for Gay & Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, told NBC News this week. But a 2010 study by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation identified more than 330 transgender inmates in a population of about 160,000, equal to about 0.2%. The National Center for Transgender Equality in the US estimates that the actual figure may be much higher. The&nbsp;prison service in England and Wales&nbsp;says it does not collate figures of transgender prisoners nationally, with a&nbsp;spokeswoman saying simply that "prison staff are required to manage transgendered prisoners in accordance with the law".</p><p>The Scottish Prison Service (SPS), which has a more enlightened policy on trans issues, confirms that in the past year, five prisoners who presented as male when entering the prison system ended up in women's jails, with seven women doing the reverse and ending up in male jails. Currently the Scottish prison population stands at 8,292, (compared with 88,179 in England and&nbsp;Wales), so that is 0.14%.</p><p>In Scotland transgender inmates are identified as soon as they go to jail, says Tom Fox, head of corporate affairs at the SPS. "In all cases, a risk assessment is conducted on arrival at the prison. Thereafter, a multidisciplinary case conference is carried out as soon as possible, [which] will decide on the management of that person. The SPS is&nbsp;developing a policy on gender identity and gender reassignment. Interim guidance developed in conjunction with relevant partners has been issued to staff. The guidance and policy is being developed in partnership with the Transgender Alliance and our legal partners." He is unsure whether any inmates have undergone surgery, but said that the SPS would permit it.</p><p>Ever since the Gender Recognition Act 2004 came into force, prisons in England and Wales have been forced to&nbsp;accommodate the needs of trans inmates who have received legal acknowledgement of their acquired gender through the issue of a gender recognition certificate. A special <a href="http://www.insidetime.org/info-rules-results.asp?rID=492&c=psi2011007_the_care_and_management_of_transsexual_prisoners" title="">prison service order</a> deals with the issue of gender-change prisoners and provides guidance for prison managers and staff. Its main tenet declares establishments must provide prisoners who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria with the same quality of care they would expect to receive from the NHS if they&nbsp;had not been sent to prison. Jails&nbsp;are instructed to permit prisoners undergoing gender reassignment to live permanently in their acquired gender. This includes dressing in appropriate clothing, adopting new names and form of address. The rules differ according to&nbsp;gender; males wishing to transition to&nbsp;females may be refused permission to&nbsp;transfer to a&nbsp;female prison on grounds of security, but female-to-male prisoners may not be refused a transfer, because there are no grounds that can prevent location in the male estate.</p><p>The position was clarified in <a href="http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2009/2220.html" title="">a high court judgment</a> in 2009. A pre-operative transgender prisoner at HMP Manchester (formerly Strangeways) asked for a judicial review after being refused a transfer to a female prison on security grounds. The judge, David Elvin QC, ruled that the decision contravened Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and ordered that the claimant be transferred to a female jail. Experts for the prison service and the claimant successfully argued that the Gender Identity Clinic in London would not approve surgery until she had spent a period living as a woman in a&nbsp;female jail. It followed that as long as she remained in the male estate, she was unable to progress towards surgery.</p><p>"The prison service seems to have confused attitudes," the claimant said in evidence. "They will not consider me as a female until I have my penis removed, notwithstanding my gender recognition certificate. Yet they resist moving me to the female estate, which would enable me to have the surgery."</p><p>The 27-year-old said she had been trying to "get this sorted" since she was 10. "It is frustrating not to be able to progress to the final stage, and I worry it&nbsp;may never happen. I get frustrated, but&nbsp;I try to deal with it on my own. I&nbsp;do&nbsp;cry and let my emotions out, but I&nbsp;do this in the privacy of my cell. It is not&nbsp;something I can discuss with anyone&nbsp;in prison."</p><p>As for what will happen to Manning, it is far from clear. LGBT groups in the US declare the military's refusal to provide hormone therapy unconstitutional. But change could be on the horizon. Last year a US judge ruled that the State Department of Correction must provide sex-reassignment surgery for Michelle Kosilek, who is serving a life sentence for murder. <a href="(http://boston.cbslocal.com/2013/04/02/federal-appeals-court-hears-sex-change-case-for-transgender-killer/" title="">Massachusetts prison officials have asked a federal appeals court to overturn the ruling</a>. If Kosilek wins, Manning may be able to expect more compassionate treatment, too.</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Xantha Leatham.</em></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/chelsea-manning">Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning)</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/wikileaks">WikiLeaks</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/espionage">Espionage</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/transgender">Transgender</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/sexuality">Sexuality</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gender">Gender</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/prisons-and-probation">Prisons and probation</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/criminal-justice">UK criminal justice</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties">US constitution and civil liberties</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ericallison">Eric Allison</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/helenpidd">Helen Pidd</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The prosecutor told the court that their story was "incoherent".</p><p>McCollum's solicitor's office said: "Mr Peter Madden, lawyer for Michaella McCollum, is currently dealing with urgent matters pertaining to Michaella's situation in Peru and making arrangements for family visits."</p><p>The pair had already spent two weeks in custody and have suffered from a lack of food and a decent bed, according to Mr Madden. He added that the pair were in effect beginning a prison sentence, as they were led away for an unknown amount of time to await their trial, which could be anything from a matter of months to up to three years away.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/peru">Peru</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/americas">Americas</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/glasgow">Glasgow</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland">Scotland</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland">Northern Ireland</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/drugs-trade">Drugs trade</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/drugs">Drugs</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Massive oil theft, sabotage of infrastructure and leaks from ageing pipelines are all cutting into the profits of the big oil companies operating in Nigeria, as well as damaging public finances.</p><p>The hundreds of spills a year in the Niger delta do serious environmental damage, destroying fishing communities and poisoning water used for drinking and bathing.</p><p>The military joint taskforce said it had discovered a leak on a pipeline near Adamakiri in Rivers state while looking for illegal oil refiners. "An assessment of the spot revealed that a brownish liquid substance was observed jetting out from an opening on the pipeline," a statement said. "The commanding officer ? attributed the leakage to corrosion on the pipeline."</p><p>A spokesman for Shell's Nigeria unit said that "oil spill containment" had been put in place but it was too early to determine the cause of the leak.</p><p>The company says most spills are due to gangs tapping pipelines to steal oil but local communities say the company is responsible for more spills than it acknowledges.</p><p>Shell is facing legal action in a UK court on behalf of 11,000 members of the Niger delta Bodo community, who say the company is responsible for spilling 500,000 barrels in 2008. Shell has admitted liability for two spills in the Bodo region but estimates the volume is far lower.</p><p>Operational problems in Nigeria cost Shell $250m in the second quarter of this year, the firm says.</p><p>Nigeria's government revenues slumped 42% in July due to production outages, it said on Friday.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria">Nigeria</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/royaldutchshell">Royal Dutch Shell</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil">Oil</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/oilandgascompanies">Oil and gas companies</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa">Africa</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The west Cork wind, often ferocious, has dropped to a whisper and the dinghies are aimlessly bobbing up and down on the tide. George, the seagull, keeps me company, looking out over the vast stretches of the Atlantic towards America. Nothing much is going on. My body clock is still set to London, twitchily looking for the next fix of doing something exciting. But this tranquil environment resists any demand for perpetual activity. There are no distractions out here from me dealing with me. This is a good thing. "He who completely entrenches himself against boredom entrenches himself against himself," said Nietzsche. Decompression is necessary, but more emotionally problematic than the simple idea that a holiday is all about fun, food and rest.</p><p>August often sits on the intersection between calm and boredom and melancholia. I stare at my computer screen and ponder the prospect of a little afternoon kip. I can't quite be bothered to work. The spiritual writers of the early church called it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acedia" title="">acedia</a> ? a sin, they thought, somewhere between sloth and world-weariness. It was the "noonday demon" that attacks the hermit from the fourth hour to the eighth. Time stands still. Nothing really matters. Acedia is the ultimate crisis of meaning.</p><p>There is something indulgent about boredom. It makes me think of posh people in Russian plays complaining they have nothing to do while other people work their arses off in the field. As Schopenhauer insisted, life for the person of means becomes a question of how to dispose of surplus time. Maybe that's why boredom feels like a problem especially associated with August and not least with children on long car journeys.</p><p>But according to the Norwegian philosopher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Svendsen" title="">Lars Svendsen</a>, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosophy-Boredom-Lars-Svendsen/dp/1861892179" title="">A Philosophy of Boredom</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b038jl6m" title="">boredom comes to take on a particular and possibly darker inflection with modernity</a>. Having been bored witless writing his PhD about Kant, Svendsen came to see a connection between his subject and his state of mind. With Kant, God is replaced by the self as the ultimate source of meaning. As traditional structures of meaning are wiped away, boredom comes to be regarded as a very personal sort of failing. And in order to avoid it, various distractions are entertained: travel, drink, drugs, the Xbox, sex, transgressive behaviour ? all strategies of avoidance, all hinting at a desperate desire to hold off the acknowledgment of meaninglessness. It is, says Svendsen, a problem characteristic of modernity. Whereas boredom has once bragged about as a mark of nobility, now it is the ultimate in personal failing. Those who are bored are losers.</p><p>Perhaps this is why the entertainment industry is more important to us that we are often prepared to admit. It comes to perform the role previously reserved for religion, where the weight of creating meaning is not shouldered by the individual alone. Entertainment keeps meaninglessness at bay.</p><p>But precisely because traditional structures of religious belief do not make meaning-generation my own responsibility, it allows us to sit with boredom with considerably less fear. And this, in turn, allows us to sit with a condition that can potentially be much more creative and reflective than being stuck in front of the TV. Think of those anxious middle-class parents that constantly fill their children's lives with improving activity. It's probably healthier just to let them be out in the garden and experience boredom, thus leading to making up games or learning to talk to each other. But, as with these children's overly managed lives, so too with their parents. We have become far too afraid of boredom and we do ourselves no favours by living a life continually in flight from it. I look up from my computer. George is still there. All is well.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/giles_fraser" title="">Twitter: @giles_fraser</a></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/christianity">Christianity</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/anglicanism">Anglicanism</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/religion">Religion</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london">London</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/gilesfraser">Giles Fraser</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

At least 42 worshippers were killed and up to 500 were wounded in the deadliest act of terror to hit the volatile country since the war started across its border two and a half years ago.</p><p>The bombs exploded as midday prayers were concluding on the first day of the Islamic weekend. Both mosques were filled with people who, minutes later, would have spilled out into car parks where the explosives-filled vehicles were parked.</p><p>"It is already hell on earth here," said Mohammed Dahbi, a mechanic from Tripoli, a Sunni Muslim-dominated city in north Lebanon. "But it could have been worse. So much worse."</p><p>A similar attack in Dahiyeh, in the Shia heartland of south Beirut, on 15 August killed 27 people.</p><p>Dahiyeh is a hub of operations for the Hezbollah militia. The Syrian war has deepened divisions between the two Islamic sects, which line up on different sides; the Sunnis largely support the opposition in Syria but Hezbollah is resolutely backing the Assad regime.</p><p>Hezbollah condemned the Tripoli attack, which it said was aimed at causing "civil strife". However, the condemnation fell on deaf ears near the scene of the blasts, with bystanders angrily blaming the group for the destruction.</p><p>"When there's a bomb in their area, they blame 'Takfiris', by whom they mean us," said Ahmed Otthman, referring to a term used to describe radical Islamists. "And when things like this happen to us, they blame Israel."</p><p>Tripoli has been the scene of repeated clashes over the past two years between its majority Sunnis and a minority community of Alawites who have remained barricaded on a hilltop suburb near the centre of the city.</p><p>The two ruling Syrian families, the Assads and the Makhloufs, are Alawites, and much of the Damascus establishment hails from the sect, which is loosely aligned to Shia Islam and comprises 12% of Syria's population.</p><p>Speakers at Friday prayers at each of the mosques had been denouncing the poison gas attack in Syria's Ghouta region, which came as the Syrian military launched a major advance into eastern areas of the capital that it continued to shell on Friday.</p><p>United Nations inspectors in Damascus were denied access for a second day to the affected areas of the capital ? only seven-10 miles from their hotel.</p><p>Sources inside rebel-held districts said an active network of defectors, some of whom had fled the Syrian military's chemical warfare division, were helping to smuggle biological samples from the scenes of the attack to Jordan. At least three more victims suffering mild effects of gassing will be transferred to Jordan in the next few days.</p><p>The samples being sourced are biopsies of livers and spleens from fatalities, as well as blood and urine from survivors.</p><p>Rebel groups have received contact from investigators identifying themselves as UN team members asking for co-operation in providing samples. The investigators have apparently asked for biological samples to be taken from animals, too. The Guardian has been unable to verify if the contact was from the UN.</p><p>A questionnaire distributed to some rebel commanders asks for GPS co-ordinates of the attacks and launch sites as well as all medical records of victims, laboratory results and environmental samples.</p><p>Chemical weapons experts interviewed by the Guardian said that symptoms of the dead and dying depicted on videos posted online support a growing view that sarin was the nerve agent used in the attack, which killed up to 1,400 people.</p><p>Britain has blamed the Assad regime for the attack, the worst of its kind anywhere since Saddam Hussein's army gassed Kurds in the northern Iraqi town of Halabja in 1988, killing between 3,000-5,000 people.</p><p>However, the US continued to toe a cautious line, asking its intelligence community to gather more information before deciding what to do about it.</p><p>Eastern Ghouta has been a stronghold of rebel groups for much of the past year. Persistent bombing by Syrian military jets and artillery has been unable to dislodge armed opposition groups who have been poised on the edge of the capital's inner sanctum, but unable to advance.</p><p>The Syrian news agency, Sana, said the operation carried out in the early hours of Thursday was the largest launched since the civil war began. It said it aimed to clear the east of the capital and then pave the way for a push towards the Jordanian border, which remains bitterly contested by both sides.</p><p>The Syrian regime has been advancing in parts of the country, with the help of forces from Hezbollah, particularly in Homs and the west. However, it has been unable to clear the capital of rebel groups, which continue to pose a potent threat to its institutions.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria">Syria</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast">Middle East and North Africa</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests">Arab and Middle East unrest</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/lebanon">Lebanon</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-chulov">Martin Chulov</a></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/mona-mahmood">Mona Mahmood</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

She was taken to the Jaslok hospital after the attack, where doctors said her condition was stable. Police said the five suspects had been identified, and one was arrested on Friday.</p><p>The photojournalist, who works as an intern with the magazine, had gone inside the sprawling Shakti Mills compound at about 6pm along with another intern, a male photographer, to shoot the derelict structures.</p><p>"Five men who were inside the abandoned mill first accused the woman's companion of being wanted for a murder, tied him up with a belt, then took the woman aside and took turns raping her," said Mumbai police commissioner Satya Pal Singh.</p><p>After the fatal gang-rape of a 23-year-old physiotherapist on a Delhi bus last December, Mumbai was often put forward as a city where women could feel safe. "Mumbai was always safe for women, but in recent years the emphasis of the police and the home department has shifted from protecting women to restricting women's freedom," said Kavita Krishnan, a women's activist.</p><p>"Mumbai's famous textile mill area was once one of the safest neighbourhoods in the city, with men and women working together," said Krishnan. "It's sad that this has happened now."</p><p>Krishnan recalled recent instances of "moral policing" in the city, in which policemen targeted women in restaurants and bars. Maharashtra state's home minister, RR Patil, has also closed bars where women dance on stage despite strictures from the supreme court.</p><p>News photographers and journalists staged a demonstration on Friday in protest against the gang-rape. "Like every woman in Mumbai, I have held on desperately to the hope that women are safe in this city," blogged journalist Deepanjana Pal. "Yesterday, that faith was brutally violated."</p><p>Although violence against women is not considered as bad as in Delhi, reported crimes against women in Mumbai more than doubled in the first four months of 2013, with 123 sexual attacks in a total of 1,098 cases. Last Sunday, a woman from the US was attacked and robbed on a commuter train in the city's business district. A Spanish woman was raped by a burglar in November.</p><p>Journalist Naresh Fernandes said: "If Mumbai's women come to believe that the city is unsafe, then the battle is lost, regardless of the crime statistics."</p><p>After the gang-rape in Delhi, the law was amended to make it more difficult for rapists to escape with light punishments. Thursday's attack has prompted demands for tougher laws."There has to be deterrence. Must have stricter laws," tweeted the law minister, Kapil Sibal, who is also a prominent lawyer.</p><p>But many women activists oppose such a move. "The laws are adequate, what we need is more focus on women's safety," said Mumbai lawyer Flavia Agnes. "There's a strong culture of women working in Mumbai ? they have always been accepted in the public space, and we should ensure that's not lost."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/india">India</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/rape">Rape</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women">Women</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/maseehrahman">Maseeh Rahman</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Can a woman write a Great American Novel? Is there such a thing as material more or less suitable to a woman? Can a woman protagonist somehow stand for humanity or just (in Kushner's words) "the eternal rib"?</p><p>Perhaps the most important American literary taste-maker, James Wood, gave it a lengthy rave review <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2013/04/08/130408crbo_books_wood" title="">in the New Yorker</a>, calling it "scintillatingly alive ? It ripples with stories, anecdotes, set-piece monologues, crafty egotistical tall tales, and hapless adventures". Novelist Jonathan Franzen has called her "a thrilling and prodigious novelist".</p><p><a href=" http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/133023/the-mythmakers" title="">Elsewhere</a>, though, the novel has prompted accusations that its so-called "macho" qualities (there is a great deal of speed, risk and bodily excitement) explain "why it has been received so enthusiastically by the critics". <a href=" http://www.salon.com/2013/06/05/rachel_kushners_ambitious_new_novel_scares_male_critics/" title="">In Salon</a> she was dubbed the novelist "who scares male critics ? When Rachel Kushner ? not a venerable male auteur ? writes the Great American Novel, male reviewers are flummoxed".</p><p>Tibin, chairing an event with the writer at the Edinburgh international book festival, put it more humorously: it was as if Kushner was announcing that "if anyone thinks there is a 'male novel', and anyone thinks that women should write a different kind of novel, I've just arrived on a motorbike covered in leather and I am ready to eat you all".</p><p>"Writer rolls her eyes," said Kushner in response to a question about the debate. "That preoccupation is not my battle ? However, some of the debate has centred around this idea that I use male material. But to me it's not male material, or rather if it is male material I guess there's part of me that's male, because I wrote the book that was in me and was natural for me to write."</p><p>The Flamethrowers is Kushner's second novel. The 44-year-old lives with her husband and son in Los Angeles (she began writing the book in the month her boy was born), and grew up in Oregon, the child of bohemian-academic parents. "Growing up, I was not told that there were women's areas of preoccupation or male ones," she said.</p><p>The novel's narrator, nicknamed Reno, is using her bike to become a land artist ? racing through a dried-up lake bed in Utah and photographing the tracks as a vast sculpture. The novel, in Kushner's words, "combines 1970s radical politics in Italy with the art world in New York and motorcycle racing in the American west".</p><p>"My dad had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Black_Shadow" title="">Vincent Black Shadow</a>, which was a quite particular thing: it was the fastest cycle of its era ? It sparked a world for me; when I was old enough I got a motorcycle."</p><p>She added: "Someone had described [the book] as being macho. But I don't think of myself as a macho writer. I don't have any outside view of myself and if I did I would probably be creatively inhibited. I just write in the way that I write." She added that with the great writers whom she admires ? notably Don DeLillo, to whom Tibin compared her in Edinburgh ? she felt a connection that was beyond gender. "When I read those novelists I feel those are my kindred companions in the world ? I want to be like them but I don't want to be like men ? it's just that we're all writers."</p><p>Tibin said the book's style was "amazing: the control of the sentences, the way each one has a flourish or a way of handling tone and texture that is brave and wonderful". This did not come without a struggle: it took two years, Kushner said, to write the first chapter. "It was just a matter of trying and trying and trying ? and deep patience. I knew once I found the right register for the narrator's voice I could answer a lot of&nbsp;questions."</p><p>She added: "I don't really know what the Great American Novel is. I like the idea that there could be one now and I wouldn't object if someone thought it was mine, but I don't claim to have written that ? I just wrote my book."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction">Fiction</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/edinburgh-book-festival">Edinburgh International Book Festival</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/edinburghfestival">Edinburgh festival</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/festivals">Festivals</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/charlottehiggins">Charlotte Higgins</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The medical examiner's office will determine a cause of death.</p><p>It was the latest in a spate of bias attacks this year in New York. Sixty-eight have been reported, from yelled slurs to the May killing of a 32-year-old gay man in Greenwich Village. Police stepped up patrols this summer in response.</p><p>Last year, 54 attacks total were reported.</p><p>Nettles and a friend, another transgender woman, were out Saturday evening in Harlem when they ran into a group of men, and one pounced, punching Nettles in the face, police said. But a witness who spoke to authorities initially did not mention any anti-gay remarks, and the suspect, 20-year-old Paris Wilson, was arrested on an assault charge.</p><p>After the attack, Nettles was hospitalized, slipped into a coma and later died.</p><p>The witness eventually told detectives about the anti-gay remarks, and the hate crimes task force took over the investigation. Detectives are looking at whether the suspect had propositioned Nettles. Upgraded charges are possible following the medical examiner's ruling, police said.</p><p>In May, police said Mark Carson, 32, was first taunted with homophobic slurs, then shot in the head in Greenwich Village, not far from the site of 1969 Stonewall riots that helped give rise to the gay rights movement.</p><p>A suspect was arrested on a charge of murder as a hate crime. The killing, and other bias attacks, sparked a summer protest attended by thousands.</p><p>Some of the other bias incidents this summer included an assault last week where two men were attacked in Chelsea.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/new-york">New York</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-crime">US crime</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa">United States</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nypd">NYPD</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"It is necessary for this court to be satisfied that they can recognise the defendant," the judge said.</p><p>"While I obviously respect the right to dress in any way she wishes, certainly while outside the court, the interests of justice are paramount. I can't, as a circuit judge, accept a plea from a person whose identity I am unable to ascertain.</p><p>"It would be easy for someone on a later occasion to appear and claim to be the defendant. The court would have no way to check on that."</p><p>Claire Burtwistle, the woman's barrister, told the court the woman was not prepared to lower her veil at all while men were in the room. The woman cannot be named for legal reasons.</p><p>"In front of women, it is not an issue. It is simply men that she will not allow to see her face," the barrister said.</p><p>Burtwistle suggested that she, a female police officer or a female prison guard could identify the defendant and confirm to the court that it was the same person as in the police arrest photos.</p><p>Sarah Counsell, prosecuting, said the police officer in charge of the case was content that he recognised the defendant while she was in the burqa.</p><p>But the judge said: "It seems to me to be quite fundamental that the court is sure who it is dealing with. Furthermore, this court, as long as I am sitting, has the highest respect for any religious tradition a person has.</p><p>"In my courtroom also, this sometimes conflicts with the interests of a paramount need for the administration of justice. In my courtroom, that's going to come first.</p><p>"There is the principle of open justice and it can't be subject to the religion of the defendant whether the principle is observed or not.</p><p>"I am not saying this because of the particular form of dress by this defendant, I apply that to any form of dress that had the same issues."</p><p>The case was adjourned for legal argument over whether or not the defendant should have to remove her veil. It will be heard again on 12 September when the defendant is expected to enter a not guilty plea and go to trial.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/criminal-justice">UK criminal justice</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/hackney">Hackney</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london">London</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/islam">Islam</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/religion">Religion</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/race">Race issues</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/shane-hickey">Shane Hickey</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Nidal said he opened fire on fellow soldiers to protect Muslim insurgents abroad.</p><p>The army psychiatrist acknowledged carrying out the attack in a crowded waiting room, where unarmed troops were making final preparations to deploy to Afghanistan and Iraq. Thirteen people were killed and more than 30 wounded.</p><p>Because Hasan never denied his actions, the court-martial was always less about a conviction than about ensuring that he received the death penalty. From the beginning of the case, the federal government has sought to execute Hasan, believing that any sentence short of a lethal injection would deprive the military and the families of the dead of the justice they have sought for nearly four years.</p><p>A jury of 13 high-ranking military officers reached a unanimous guilty verdict in about seven hours. Hasan had no visible reaction as the verdict was read. In the next phase of the trial, they must all agree to give Hasan the death penalty before he can be sent to the military's death row, which has just five other prisoners. If they do not agree, the 42-year-old could spend the rest of his life in prison.</p><p>Hasan, a Virginia-born Muslim, said the attack was a jihad against US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He bristled when the trial judge, Colonel Tara Osborn, suggested the attack could have been avoided were it not for a spontaneous flash of anger.</p><p>"It wasn't done under the heat of sudden passion," Hasan said, before jurors began deliberating. "There was adequate provocation ? that these were deploying soldiers that were going to engage in an illegal war."</p><p>All but one of the dead were soldiers, including a pregnant private who curled on the floor and pleaded for her baby's life.</p><p>The sentencing phase is expected to begin with more testimony from survivors of the attack inside an army medical center where soldiers were waiting in long lines to receive immunizations and medical clearance for deployment. About 50 soldiers and civilians testified of hearing someone scream "Allahu akbar!" ? Arabic for "God is great!" ? and seeing a man in army camouflage open fire. Many identified Hasan as the gunman and recalled his handgun's red and green laser sights piercing a room made dark with gun smoke.</p><p>Hasan, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/21/fort-hood-shooting-nidal-hasan-rests-defense">who acted as his own attorney</a>, began the trial by telling jurors he was the gunman. But he said little else over the next three weeks, which convinced his court-appointed standby lawyers that Hasan's only goal was to get a death sentence. As the trial progressed, those suspicions grew. The military called nearly 90 witnesses, but Hasan rested his case without calling a single person to testify in his defense and made no closing argument. Yet he leaked documents during the trial to journalists that revealed him telling military mental health workers that he could "still be a martyr" if executed.</p><p>Death sentences are rare in the military and trigger automatic appeals that take decades play out. Among the final barriers to execution is authorization from the president. No American soldier has been executed since 1961.</p><p>Hasan spent weeks planning the 5 November 2009, attack. His preparation included buying the handgun and videotaping a sales clerk showing him how to change the magazine. He later paid $10 at a gun range outside Austin and asked for pointers on how to reload with speed and precision. An instructor said he told Hasan to practice while watching TV or sitting on his couch with the lights off.</p><p>When the time came, Hasan stuffed paper towels in the pockets of his cargo pants, to muffle the rattling of extra ammo and avoid arousing suspicion. Soldiers testified that Hasan's rapid reloading made it all but impossible to stop the shooting. Investigators recovered 146 shell casings inside the medical building and dozens more outside, where Hasan shot at the backs of soldiers fleeing toward the parking lot.</p><p>The first person to charge Hasan, a civilian doctor, was shot dead while wielding a chair. Another soldier who ran at him with a table was stopped upon being shot in the hand. Chief warrant officer Christopher Royal saw an opening after hearing the distinct clicking of the gun's chamber emptying. But he slipped on a puddle of blood while starting a sprint toward Hasan. He was shot in the back.</p><p>Tight security blanketed the trial. The courthouse was made into a fortress insulated by a 20ft cushion of blast-absorbing blockades, plus an outer perimeter of shipping containers stacked three high. A helicopter ferried Hasan back and forth each day. The small courtroom was guarded by soldiers carrying high-powered rifles.</p><p>In court, Hasan never played the role of an angry extremist. He did not get agitated or raise his voice. He addressed Osborn as "ma'am" and occasionally whispered "thank you" when prosecutors, in accordance with the rules of admitting evidence, handed Hasan red pill bottles that rattled with bullet fragments removed from those who were shot.</p><p>Prosecutors never charged Hasan as a terrorist ? an omission that still galls family members of the slain and survivors, some of whom have sued the US government over missing the warning signs of Hasan's views before the attack.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/fort-hood-shootings">Fort Hood shootings</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-military">US military</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gun-crime">Gun crime</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-crime">US crime</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/texas">Texas</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa">United States</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"NSA takes very seriously allegations of misconduct, and cooperates fully with any investigations ? responding as appropriate. NSA has zero tolerance for willful violations of the agency's authorities."</p><p>Though likely to be a small subset of the thousands of supposedly accidental rule breaches recently <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-broke-privacy-rules-thousands-of-times-per-year-audit-finds/2013/08/15/3310e554-05ca-11e3-a07f-49ddc7417125_story.html">revealed by the Washington Post</a>, these cases flatly contradict assurances given by President Obama that the NSA was only ever acting in good faith.</p><p>Asked by CNN interviewer Chris Cuomo on Thursday whether he was "confident that you know everything that's going on within that agency and that you can say to the American people, 'It's all done the right way'?", Obama insisted he was.</p><p>"Because there are no allegations, and I am very confident ? knowing the NSA and how they operate ? that purposefully somebody is out there trying to abuse this program or listen in on people's email," he <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/23/politics/barack-obama-new-day-interview-transcript/index.html?hpt=po_c1">said in the interview</a> that aired on Friday.</p><p>The fresh revelations came as Obama's new privacy watchdog delivered its first bark, with a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/778168/pclob-guidelines-letter-1.pdf">letter to intelligence chiefs</a> urging them draft stronger rules on domestic surveillance, something it revealed had not been updated for 30 years.</p><p>The intervention of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, its first since the appointment of new staff by the White House earlier this year, came as Obama acknowledged that technology was outpacing the checks put in place to protect privacy and said the National Security Agency was "scary to people".</p><p>"I think there are legitimate concerns that people have that technology is moving so quick that, you know, at some point, does the technology outpace the laws that are in place and the protections that are in place?," said the president in the CNN interview. "Do some of these systems end up being like a loaded gun out there that somebody at some future point could abuse?"</p><p>Hours earlier, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) wrote to director of national intelligence James Clapper and the Department of Justice calling for them to begin formulating new guidelines to reflect recent advancements in surveillance capabilities.</p><p>It said the board had "learned that key procedures that form the guidelines to protect 'information concerning United States persons' have not comprehensively been updated, in some cases in almost three decades, despite dramatic changes in information use and technology".</p><p>PLCOB also requested that "both the attorney general and the director of national intelligence work together to focus the attention necessary to update each element of the intelligence community's procedures to collect retain and disseminate US persons' information".</p><p>It said procedures should capture "both the evolution of technology and the roles and capabilities of the intelligence community since 9/11".</p><p>"Specifically, the board would appreciate receiving by October 31, 2013, an agency-by-agency schedule establishing a time frame for updating each agency's guidelines," added chairman David Medine.</p><p>"In the meantime, the board would appreciate a briefing on the status of the guidelines and process for reviewing and updating them."</p><p>Previously <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/21/privacy-civil-liberties-obama-secretive">PCLOB has been criticised </a>for being too close to the administration and failing to address growing threats to privacy, but its new-found teeth appear to co-incide with a shift in tone from the White House.</p><p>In his CNN interview Obama said: "What's been clear since the disclosures that were made by Mr Snowden is that people don't have enough information and aren't confident enough that, between all the safeguards and checks that we put in place within the executive branch, and the federal court oversight that takes place on the program, and congressional oversight, people are still concerned as to whether their emails are being read or their phone calls are being listened to."</p><p>"I recognise that we're going to have to continue to improve the safeguards and, as technology moves forward, that means that we may be able to build technologies that give people more assurance, and we do have to do a better job of giving people confidence in how these programs work."</p><p>The president hinted at a series of concessions and reforms likely to take place in the coming weeks as Congress returns and responds further to the revelations of sweeping surveillance powers triggered by the Snowden leaks.</p><p>"I am open to working with Congress to figure out, can we get more transparency in terms of how the oversight court works? Can ? do we need a public advocate in there who people have confidence in?" Obama said.</p><p>"There's no doubt that, for all the work that's been done to protect the American people's privacy, the capabilities of the NSA are scary to people."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa">NSA</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-national-security">US national security</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa">United States</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/obama-administration">Obama administration</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/barack-obama">Barack Obama</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance">Surveillance</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/privacy">Privacy</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-roberts">Dan Roberts</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
