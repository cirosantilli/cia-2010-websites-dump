PARIS, France - If the use of chemical weapons in Syria is confirmed the international community must respond with "a reaction with force", France said Thursday amid calls for the Syrian authorities to permit United Nations experts to examine the site of an alleged poison gas attack outside Damascus.

JINAN, China - Bo Xilai, the embattled Chinese politician facing trial on charges of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power, Thursday put up a spirited defense against the allegations saying he was framed.

It has become fashionable to exaggerate the risk of water wars in South Asia. It is argued that with depleting water resources, India will face tension and wars with Pakistan, China and Bangladesh. The failure to sign the Teesta River Agreement between India and Bangladesh, the growing cacophony in Pakistan against India's dams in Jammu and Kashmir, and speculations about China's plans to build ...

The trial of disgraced princeling Bo Xilai is China doing Macbeth, and its script is meticulously pre-ordained. But as he injects some extra drama into proceedings by claiming he was framed, the Man Who Would be President is proving that he won't go down without a fight. - Pepe Escobar

Events in Egypt (not to mention Washington's reluctance to cut military links with Cairo) give Beijing further justification for avoiding rapid democratic reform in China. Meanwhile, the US hunt for secrets whisteblower Edward Snowden and two court cases involving US-based Cisco Systems further highlight the consanguinity of authoritarianism in the East and West. - Peter Lee

Selective interpretation of Buddhist teachings by religious organizations in Myanmar has seen them deny responsibility for the violence and rhetoric their followers and leaders have targeted at Muslim Royingha. Such bigotry presents an image to the world that undermines the tolerance of the many Burmese who have sought an end to the pogroms. - Matthew J Walton

As the Obama administration wrestles with its reaction to the bloody aftermath of the coup in Egypt, officials and analysts worry about US ties with Saudi Arabia. While the oil-rich kingdom's strong support for the junta includes a pledge to make up for any withdrawn Western aid, tough language from Riyadh against Washington's condemnation of the coup is perhaps more worrisome. - Jim Lobe

Breakneck development in New Delhi is believed to the reason why endangered bird species are avoiding a traditional migratory stopover at wetlands in city's center. Environmentalists say designating the wetlands sanctuary as a site of international importance will guarantee its future, but claim that construction and real estate lobbies sing the only song the government can hear. - Ranjit Devraj

It is in the interests of the United States and the world to design a set of binding rules for China's superpower role in the next 10 to 20 years while they still have the ability to do so. This way, when the time comes and the US has to concede a large portion of global influence, it can be assured that China will have to work within those rules. - Zhengxu Wang

Letters sent in the 1940s among the prominent Liu family in Shanghai don't just give insight into how a powerful family of the time navigated the treacherous politics of the period, they also reflect how China would learn to master the heart of a capitalist world. - Sherman Cochran and Andrew Hsieh

The geopolitical gains to Russia of Gazprom's purchase of Kyrgyzstan's state-owned gas supplier, Kyrgyzgaz, for all of US$1 may be hard-pressed to balance the problems that come with the deal, even putting to one side the burden of debt and collapsing distribution infrastructure. - Fozil Mashrab

The latest argument supporting higher levels of growth in China is based on Beijing's plan for another major urbanization push, but too many fallacies undermine the idea that ever-more cities and infrastructure make for economic expansion.
