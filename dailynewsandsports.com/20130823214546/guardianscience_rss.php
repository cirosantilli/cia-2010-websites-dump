Lime trees also did well in the heat ? they need hot summers to flower and set seeds. Unfortunately, limes have a bad reputation for the sticky mess they drop on cars parked underneath them in streets, but the culprit is actually a foreign species of lime, and the sticky stuff is honeydew made by masses of aphids feeding on the leaves.</p><p>The native British lime, though, is one of our most ancient plants, dating back to the end of the last ice age, but is at its most northerly limits in the UK because of our cool climate. Without a hot summer, limes rarely come into flower and set seed but they have incredible powers of regeneration, by sprouting from toppled trees or branches lying on the ground. And as ash trees succumb to fungus disease, native lime trees growing in similar places may replace them.</p><p>Perhaps the best thing about limes in hot weather is their intoxicating sweet-smelling blossom, which attracts crowds of bees with nectar so sweet it sometimes leaves the bees punch drunk. The blossom can also be made into tea, which was used during the war as a mild sedative. And hot summers are also needed to make the pollen viable, fertilise the flowers and set seed, which eventually blows away using a bract like a helicopter wing, similar to a sycamore seed.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/plants">Plants</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/forests">Trees and forests</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paulsimons">Paul Simons</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Here's <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2013/mar/28/50-human-brain-ideas">the introduction to the book</a>, and my post about <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2013/aug/09/a-new-way-of-thinking-about-how-the-brain-works">the most important idea in neuroscience</a></em>. </p><p>Mirror neurons are cells that fire during both the execution and observation of a specific action. They have been linked to many behaviours and abilities, from empathy to learning by imitation, as well as implicated in conditions such as autism. Mirror neurons were discovered in monkeys, but it's still not clear whether they also exist in the human brain.<br /><br />Mirror neurons were <a href="http://www.fulminiesaette.it/_uploads/foto/legame/DiPellegrinoEBR92.pdf">identified</a> in the brains of macaque monkeys by a team of Italian researchers during experiments performed in the 1990s. The researchers, who were studying how the brain controls hand and mouth movements, implanted microelectrodes into the monkeys' brains in order to monitor the activity of single cells while the animals reached for pieces of food and put them into their mouths. These experiments revealed that the activity of certain cells increased when the monkeys performed this action.</p><p>The cells in question are located <a href="https://edit.ethz.ch/neuroscience/education/handouts/RizzolattiFadigaGalleseFogassi1996.pdf">in the premotor cortex</a>, a part of the brain involved in planning and executing movements, so the finding was not in itself particularly surprising. By chance, however, the researchers discovered that a few of the same cells also fired weakly when the animals merely observed the researchers putting food into their own mouths, and fired more strongly when they saw other monkeys performing the same action. Subsequently, the same team of researchers identified mirror neurons in several other regions of the monkey brain. They also located cells that fire when monkeys observe an action as well as when they hear the sound related to it.</p><p>But what does it all mean? The precise role of the mirror neuron system in monkeys is still not known, though the researchers who discovered them believe that they perform two functions. First, that mirror neurons are involved in understanding the actions of others ? observing an action triggers the mirror neuron system to generate a motor representation of it. This corresponds to the activity produced by the action itself: in other words, the mirror neuron system transforms the visual information into knowledge of the intention of the others' actions. The second proposed function is imitation ? or learning to perform an action by observing others.</p><h2>Casting a long reflection</h2><p>The discovery of mirror neurons was greeted with a great deal of excitement, and some have hailed it as one of the most important discoveries of modern neuroscience. Since these neurons were discovered in monkeys, researchers have speculated that the human brain may also contain mirror neurons.</p><p>In human beings, as in monkeys, mirror neurons are hypothesized to play an important role in imitation and understanding the actions of others. Some researchers argue that they are critical for many aspects of social interactions. These include understanding the intentions of others, and inferring their mental state from their behaviour (an ability referred to as theory of mind); empathy, or putting oneself 'into another's shoes'; self-awareness; and the evolution of, and the ability to learn, language.</p><p>Given their purported role in social cognition, one prominent neuroscientist has proposed that <a href="http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/looking-into-ramachandrans-broken-mirror/">a defective mirror neuron system is what causes autism</a>, a neurodevelopmental condition characterized primarily by impairments in social interaction and communication. The same researcher argues that the discovery of mirror neurons is 'the single most important "unreported" story of the decade', and has even referred to the cells as 'the neurons that shaped civilization', because human culture involves the transfer of complex skills and knowledge from person to person.</p><h2>Box: The broken mirror hypothesis</h2><p>In the late 1990s, two groups of researchers independently proposed the so-called broken-mirror hypothesis, which states the social impairments characteristic of autism are caused by defects in the mirror neuron system. The broken mirror hypothesis has received considerable attention in the mass media, but has been the subject of <a href="http://www.cbcd.bbk.ac.uk/people/scientificstaff/vicky/TICS2008">severe criticism by many autism researchers</a>. It is based on assumptions that mirror neurons are involved in understanding action, imitation and language acquisition, and that people with autism are insensitive to the emotions and intentions of others. Critics say both that the first assumption is actually false, and also that there is evidence that people with autism are in fact overly sensitive to others' emotions and intentions. What's more, the broken-mirror hypothesis does not attempt to explain how the mirror neuron system is defective, or how the defects might arise.</p><h2>But do <em>we</em> have mirror neurons?</h2><p>Mirror neurons have proven to be highly controversial. A handful of brain- scanning studies show that several regions of the brain are activated during both action execution and observation, and it has been suggested that these areas constitute the human mirror system. But while hundreds of other studies attempt to explain their results by alluding to mirror neurons, very few actually provide hard evidence.</p><p>So there is, as yet, very little convincing direct evidence that mirror neurons exist in the human brain. In fact, a number of studies have <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/24/9925.long">failed to find evidence of human mirror neurons altogether</a>. In 2009, for example, Harvard researchers exploited a phenomenon called adaptation, whereby neurons reduce their activity in response to the same repetitive stimulus. The researchers showed their participants a film clip of hand gestures and asked them to mimic the action. The scans showed that the cells adapted when the gestures were observed and mimicked, but not when they were mimicked first and then observed.</p><p>One of the difficulties is that researchers rarely get the opportunity to examine the working human brain directly. In 2010, though, one research group who had just such an opportunity, while evaluating the brains of conscious epileptic patients about to undergo neurosurgery, claimed that they had obtained <a href="http://iacoboni.bol.ucla.edu/pdfs/CurrBiol_V20p750.pdf">the first direct evidence of human mirror neurons</a>. Some of these cells fired both when the patients performed and observed an action, but the activity of almost as many cells decreased during execution and observation, raising doubts that they are indeed mirror neurons. Furthermore, the cells were located in the hippocampus, an area involved in memory formation, and not previously thought to be part of the presumed mirror neuron system.</p><p>The researchers who originally discovered mirror neurons in the monkey brain have recently refined their claims, and now suggest that the cells have a far more restricted role than was originally thought. Instead of being involved in understanding the actions of others, they suggest that the cells play a role in helping us to understand, '<a href="http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~pineda/COGS260Mirroring/readings/Rizzolatti_NatureRevNeurosci10.pdf">from the inside</a>', actions that we already know how to perform. Critics argue that this confirms the alternative theory that mirror neurons are involved instead in selecting and controlling actions.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/neuroscience">Neuroscience</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Smith [Oxford University Press, 2013; <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199734542/livithescieli-21/">Amazon UK</a>; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199734542/livingthescie-20/">Amazon US</a>/<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00DI8RLXK/livingthescie-20/">kindle US</a>] <br /><strong>Publisher's synopsis</strong> Few people confess easily to taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. Maybe this is why there is no word for the feeling in English. And so schadenfreude, that beguiling German word, is borrowed to label the experience. But most of us can secretly think of many times when a misfortune suffered by someone gave us pleasure. What sports fan can suppress delight when a hated rival loses? Political junkies know the thrill of a scandal befalling an opposing candidate. How about when an envied friend suffers a little setback? Who fails to laugh when an arrogant but untalented contestant is humiliated on American Idol, or when the embarrassing vice of an ideological politician is exposed? <br />This book, written by one of the world's foremost scholars of envy and shame, explores the emotion we dare not admit to: schadenfreude. From garden-variety envy and competition to malignant intent and concepts of deservingness and comeuppance, psychologist Richard Smith explains why we feel schadenfreude with examples ranging from literary works and reality television to neuroscience. Although schadenfreude is hardly a feeling to nourish in oneself or to encourage as a cultural habit, Smith argues that there is no getting rid of it, when the misfortunes of others can lead to our benefit. Indeed, schadenfreude can be sweet revenge when it is personal, but as Smith argues in a fascinating exploration of anti-semitism in the 20th century that concludes the book, this passive thrill can lead to devastating consequences.<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> Even though most people won't admit that they have felt pleasure at someone else's pain or failure, this doesn't mean that they are strangers to such emotions. Indeed, <em>schadenfreude</em> is a universal human emotion, so why should we learn more about it? In this eye-opening and readable book, the author describes his experiments for identifying and investigating <em>schadenfreude</em> and argues that by examining this emotion, we will better understand human nature and ourselves. He then argues that our understanding will allow us to redirect our energies towards more useful and altruistic emotions and behaviours. </p><p><img align="right" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7285/9565480864_236c6b4358_m.jpg" width="159" height="240" /> The Great Escape: Health, Wealth, and the Origins of Inequality by Angus Deaton [Princeton University Press, 2013; <a href="http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780691153544">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/069115354X/livithescieli-21/">Amazon UK</a>; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/069115354X/livingthescie-20/">Amazon US</a>/<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00CXTMWKM/livingthescie-20/">kindle US</a>] <br /><strong>Publisher's synopsis</strong> The world is a better place than it used to be. People are wealthier and healthier, and live longer lives. Yet the escapes from destitution by so many have left gaping inequalities between people and between nations. In The Great Escape, Angus Deaton -- one of the foremost experts on economic development and on poverty -- tells the remarkable story of how, starting 250 years ago, some parts of the world began to experience sustained progress, opening up gaps and setting the stage for today's hugely unequal world. Deaton takes an in-depth look at the historical and ongoing patterns behind the health and wealth of nations, and he addresses what needs to be done to help those left behind.<br />Deaton describes vast innovations and wrenching setbacks: the successes of antibiotics, pest control, vaccinations, and clean water on the one hand, and disastrous famines and the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the other. He examines the United States, a nation that has prospered but is today experiencing slower growth and increasing inequality. He also considers how economic growth in India and China has improved the lives of more than a billion people. Deaton argues that international aid has been ineffective and even harmful. He suggests alternative efforts -- including reforming incentives to drug companies and lifting trade restrictions -- that will allow the developing world to bring about its own Great Escape.<br />Demonstrating how changes in health and living standards have transformed our lives, The Great Escape is a powerful guide to addressing the well-being of all nations. <br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> Inequality is a real hot-button issue for me, so I had to read this book. Written by an economist, this book does something unusual; it examines how physical and financial well-being go hand-in-hand and, along with education and plain old-fashioned luck, play a pivotal role in people's "great escape" from the poverty trap. In this book, the author investigates the different sorts of inequality, whether it helps or hurts and what it does to individuals and to society. The book ends by reminding us of our moral duties, arguing what can and ought (and ought not) to be done to rectify inequality and discusses whether there can be a happy ending, unlike in the movie, <em>The Great Escape</em>. </p><p><img align="right" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2829/9565463540_8cae21623d_m.jpg" width="154" height="240" /> The Palestinian-Israeli Conflict: A Very Short Introduction by Martin Bunton [Oxford University Press, 2013; <a href="http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780199603930">Guardian Bookshop</a>; <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199603936/livithescieli-21/">Amazon UK</a>; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199603936/livingthescie-20/">Amazon US</a>/<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00DZIB5XK/livingthescie-20/">kindle US</a>] <br /><strong>Publisher's synopsis</strong> The conflict between Palestine and Israel is one of the most highly publicized and bitter struggles in history. In this accessible and stimulating Very Short Introduction, Martin Bunton clearly explains the history of the problem, reducing it to its very essence - a modern territorial contest between two nations and one geographical territory. <br />Adopting a fresh and original approach, each section covers a twenty-year span, to highlight the historical complexity of the conflict throughout successive decades. Each chapter starts with an examination of the relationships among people and events that marked particular years as historical moments in the evolution of the conflict, including the 1897 Basle Congress; the 1917 Balfour Declaration and British occupation of Palestine; and the 1947 UN Partition Plan and the war for Palestine. <br />Providing a clear and fair exploration of the main issues, Bunton explores not only the historical basis of the conflict, but also looks at how and why partition has been so difficult and how efforts to restore peace continue today.<br /><strong>My first impression:</strong> Like most people, I have spent a significant portion of my life being utterly confused about the source of the enduring conflict between Israel and Palestine. This pocket-sized book argues that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is not an ancient religious battle (as I had always been told), but instead, it is a more recent territorial contest. This readable book presents a chronological historical overview of how this multi-layered conflict unfolded over the past 120 years and the challenges involved with two nations sharing one small piece of land. It'll be interesting to learn what others think of this particular argument. </p><p>What book(s) are you reading? How far are you along in the book? What do you think of it so far?

But the intelligence establishment has previously used science diplomacy as a cover for its own ends</p><p>The Obama Administration has embraced the concept of science diplomacy as a way to bridge cultural and economic gaps between the United States and the rest of the world. The director of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp">White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy</a>, John P Holdren, regularly meets with his science policy counterparts from Brazil, China, India, Japan, Korea and Russia. The <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/11/200356.htm">US State Department has sent a series of American scientists abroad as "Science Envoys"</a> in hopes of using scientific relationships as an olive branch to the Muslim world. Since 2009, these science envoys, acting as private citizens, have collectively visited almost 20 countries, including Indonesia, Morocco, Bangladesh, Kazahkstan and pre-revolution Egypt. <br /><br />This new interest in science diplomacy is at least partially explained by the nature of contemporary global problems: issues of resource distribution, climate change, and uneven economic growth can only be solved with input from science. Climate change, for instance, does not respect international borders; addressing it will require international partnerships. Nor do American scientists hold a monopoly on good ideas. For these and a host of other reasons, science diplomacy makes good sense and promises benefits for the countries on either end of scientific exchange. </p><p>But science diplomacy programmes also draw on a long tradition that holds science and scientists as uniquely qualified to spread American ideals. In the 1960s (the last time that the United States made a sustained effort to use science diplomacy to build international partnerships), the concept was marred by ties to propaganda campaigns and intelligence operations. The idea was that foreign elites who adopted the values of science ? objectivity, internationalism, the free exchange of information ? would be more receptive to American overtures more generally. This assumption drove most US science diplomacy throughout the Cold War. </p><p>When government sponsorship was explicit ("overt"), neither intelligence gathering nor pro-American reporting would have come as a surprise: anyone agreeing to participate in a US government-sponsored scientific meeting, circa 1962, probably knew what they were getting into. </p><p>Things got much murkier when the foreign policy establishment turned to groups of private citizens as ambassadors for science. An oddity of the history of American diplomacy is that the United States routinely conducted its Cold War cultural campaigns through arms-length arrangements. In a few cases, the groups engaged in so-called "private diplomacy" really were unaffiliated, but ? more often than not ? organisations touting their "independent" work on behalf of the US government received help, usually with financial support channeled through fake philanthropic foundations. The pass-through strategy was common in US international activities from approximately 1948 until 1967, when an article in Ramparts magazine uncovered the CIA's covert funding of the National Student Association (a youth organisation), and caused a major foreign policy scandal.</p><p>Science turned out to be a particularly good fit for this sort of arm's-length operation. All attempts at private diplomacy offered benefits of economy and plausible deniability, but private science diplomacy carried the additional weight of reinforcing American ideals. The American version of "science" that these scientists and their patrons at the CIA had in mind stressed disinterestedness, objectivity and scientist-driven research organisations. They portrayed Soviet science, in contrast, as enslaved to the state, overly focused on technology and driven by ideology. Who better to spread this message than private scientists, working as individuals? By definition, this worldview undermined the ability of overtly sponsored US government science diplomacy to promote the American message. </p><p>Consider a specific example. In the early 1960s, the Boulder, Colorado-based<a href="http://www.bscs.org/"> Biological Sciences Curriculum Study</a> produced a series of innovative biology textbooks; it's still around today. In 1961, the BSCS started accepting funds from the Asia Foundation (now known to be a CIA pass-through) for its international programmes. Like many of the private organisations that received at least part of their funding through the CIA, the BSCS also received support from legitimate philanthropic organisations, including the Rockefeller Foundation and US government agencies, including the National Science Foundation. Nor is it entirely clear whether the BSCS's leaders were aware of the true source of Asia Foundation funds: Arnold Grobman, the BSCS's long-time executive director, denied any knowledge of such links in an interview with me a few months before his death, in the fall of 2011. </p><p>In any case, between 1961 and 1967, the BSCS and its overseas affiliates received 10s of thousands of dollars from the Asia Foundation to underwrite the adaptation and translation of biology textbooks in Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and other nations on the Chinese perimeter. From the historical evidence, the BSCS's overseas adaptation offices don't appear to be cover for something nefarious: they really did focus on biology curriculum reform, especially textbook translation. The only thing sketchy about these offices was that their support came from a different source than their local participants (and possibly even their American partners) believed.</p><p>And that's the problem. Covers can be blown. When the Asia Foundation's board of trustees acknowledged their ties to the CIA in 1967 (in an attempt to pre-empt yet another damaging story in Ramparts), the BSCS's entire overseas operation came under suspicion. Indian authorities, for instance, briefly threatened to kick out any group that received funding from the Asia Foundation; it took the BSCS years to re-establish trust with the foreign ministers of education who had previously embraced their work. A similar fate befell almost all projects that involved Americans abroad, as all "private support" became synonymous with "CIA front". Covert operations discredited the concept of cultural diplomacy for a generation. </p><p>The Obama administration's resurrection of the concept of science diplomacy offers enormous potential. But, once again, the intelligence establishment has found in science diplomacy a convenient cover for its own needs. The CIA's use of a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna">fake vaccination campaign</a> in the hunt for Osama bin Laden and the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/28/aid-agency-pakistan-cia-vaccination">subsequent withdrawal of aid workers from Pakistan</a> over fears for their safety, are all too familiar. Once again, covert operations are threatening to derail genuinely helpful, hopeful activities that might otherwise go a long way toward building international goodwill. The state department's insistence on calling its science envoys "private citizens", too, is cause for concern. Since the science envoys are obviously doing the state department's work, why not call them "officials" and avoid the potential for confusion? The US has been there before. This time, science diplomacy is worth doing right.</p><p><em><a href="http://audrajwolfe.com/">Audra J. Wolfe</a> is a writer, editor and historian based in Philadelphia.

The reality is that English is a flexible friend</p><p>Two weeks ago, there was a literal brouhaha over news that English dictionaries around the world had finally given in and ruined English by entering the hyperbolic and figurative meaning of "literally". While people flapped their hands and began to eulogize our fine language, lexicographers battened down the hatches and waited for the storm to pass, as it would. The death of English was literally (senses 1 and 2) old news to us.</p><p>As far back as the 15th century, English speakers were bemoaning the shortcomings of their language. The earliest worries were that English simply didn't have enough words in it: England's own poet laureate whinged in 1545 that his native language was so full of difficulties that he didn't think he'd be able to find the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pUVbAAAAMAAJ&q=%22termes+to+serve+my+mynde%22&dq=%22termes+to+serve+my+mynde%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QrIVUujFHIbc9AT27oHACQ&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg">"termes to serve my mynde"</a>. By the 1700s, the idea that unless upright citizens who cared about grammar stepped in, "good" and "proper" English might dwindle into nothing was already well established. </p><p>The complaints of today are the complaints of yesteryear. "Literally", some claim, can't be used hyperbolically because doing so contradicts its own root, which means "actual, according to fact". Linguists call the idea that a word's current meaning need be tied to the meaning of its root "etymological fallacy", and it is not a new idea. The extended sense of "decimate" that means "to destroy completely" was an early target of such handwringing; it was decried in the 1800s. The hyperbolic "literally" is a relative newcomer, only garnering the attention of usage commentators in 1922. </p><p>The bemoaning is for naught: most words eventually develop different meanings from their roots. Should we abandon "nice" because its root means "wanton" or "dissolute"? Will you stop eating stew when you find out "stew" used to be a synonym for "whorehouse"? What about pasta puttanesca (Italian, short for <em>alla puttanesca</em>, "in the style of a prostitute")? </p><p>Perhaps your concern is not etymological, but cultural. The hyperbolic use of "literally" is, in your view, another language fad among the youth that is contributing to the downfall of English. This, too, is not a new complaint. Everything from verbing ("I <em>friended</em> him on Facebook") to clipping slang ("<em>wevs</em>" for "whatever") to the discourse particle "like" ("I was, <em>like</em>, so upset about 'literally'") is heralded as a fresh, new linguistic hell, but all these dastardly things that are supposedly the fault of today's teenagers are, in fact, centuries old.</p><p>Shakespeare <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8vAjAAAAMAAJ&dq=grace%20me%20no%20grace%20nor%20uncle%20me%20no%20uncle&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q=grace%20me%20no%20grace%20nor%20uncle%20me%20no%20uncle&f=false">verbed nouns</a>; the discourse particle "like" was common in some dialects of English as <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=K54yEJRv3A4C&dq=%22put%20it%20right%20in%20the%20ticket%2C%20like%22&pg=PA326#v=onepage&q=%22put%20it%20right%20in%20the%20ticket,%20like%22&f=false">far back as the 1800s</a>; and my favorite example of clipping slang comes from the title of a 1567 poem (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ogJAAAAAYAAJ&dq=after%20misaduentures%20come%20good%20haps&pg=PA609#v=onepage&q=after%20misaduentures%20come%20good%20haps&f=false">"After misadventures come good haps"</a>). As has been reported elsewhere, the hyperbolic "literally" has been in consistent and unironic use for two centuries. That these types of words have been in our language for so long, and yet have not felled it, must mean either that English is a bulwark never failing, or that young people eventually grow up and learn that some words are fine in some contexts but not in others.</p><p>There is, of course, always the fad for linguistic jingoism: this new sense of "literally" is American English and is therefore substandard and suspect. Samuel Johnson, the great 18th-century British lexicographer and curmudgeon, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=CTY4Xa43XlAC&pg=PT115&dq=%22immerse+himself+and+his+posterity+for+ages+in+barbarism%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=C7YVUv7jLbTF4AOs3IHIDA&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22immerse%20himself%20and%20his%20posterity%20for%20ages%20in%20barbarism%22&f=false">is famously quoted</a> as saying that Americans "are a race of convicts, and ought to be thankful for anything we allow them short of hanging", and that "a man of any intellectual enjoyment will not easily go [to America] and immerse himself and his posterity for ages in barbarism." It's no wonder, then, that any disliked word is sneered at in the UK as being an Americanism. </p><p>And yet, this too is often a spurious claim. In 2011, the BCC News Magazine invited readers to send in their most hated American lexical invaders, and subsequently published a list called "<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14201796">Americanisms: 50 of your most noted examples</a>". Of the 50 Americanisms given, 28 of them are actually British in origin, including "period" for "full stop" and "zee" for "zed".</p><p>The worry is that British English will be lost, overrun by the barbarous convicts Johnson was so antipathetic towards, but it is unfounded. British English has adopted some Americanisms, just as American English has adopted some Britishisms ("ginger" is having quite a moment over here). But there are still enough vocabularic and syntactical differences between the two dialects that they remain separate. Each dialect will absorb vocabulary from the other harmlessly. If you won't believe an American lexicographer, then perhaps you'll believe the very British Steven Poole, who made the same point in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/13/americanisms-closer-to-home-imagine">his Guardian column of 13 May</a>.</p><p>In 1490, William Caxton wrote:</p><blockquote class="quoted"><p>Our language now used varies far from that which was used and spoken when I was born ? Certainly it is hard to please every man because of diversity and change of language.</p></blockquote><p>Well-read, well-meaning people have been worrying for over 500 years that English is going to hell in a handbasket, and yet here we are, speaking English. The fuss over "literally" is literally nothing in the grand scheme of English's reign.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/language">Language</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/linguistics">Linguistics</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa">United States</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kory-stamper">Kory Stamper</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Who are the Luddites?</p><p>Alan Rusbridger's <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/19/david-miranda-schedule7-danger-reporters">cinematic description</a> of how, back in July, two GCHQ security experts oversaw the destruction of hard drives in the basement of the Guardian's offices was symbolic of many things. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/aug/21/smashing-snowden-hard-drives-sinister">Amnesty called it "sinister"</a>. It made me think of the Luddites.</p><p>We're almost halfway through the bicentennial of the Luddite uprisings (1811-1817). Part of a wave of working class discontent emerging in the wake of the harsh economic climate of the Napoleonic wars, the Luddites are best known for smashing looms and the word Luddite is now commonly used to denote someone opposed to, possibly fearful of, technological progress. But Luddite activism was really more about who got to control technology than being opposed to any technology itself. As <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/30/unthinkable-the-luddite-fallacy">a 2011 Guardian editorial noted</a>, Huddersfield Luddite, George Mellor directed his followers to "leave the machines, shoot the masters". </p><p>A cynic might argue that the traditional painting of Luddites as somewhat ignorant and simply scared of progress is a version of history perpetuated by those who would rather we didn't question the machines of our masters. I'd have some sympathy with that cynic, because the Luddites were not anti-technology in general, and the word is all too often used to close down debate about what we want progress to look like. </p><p>Many of us have been tempted to take hammers to one hard drive or another (tip if you do: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/20/nsa-snowden-files-drives-destroyed-london">Rusbridger et al used angle grinders</a>). A friend who works near <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-roundabout">Silicon Roundabout</a> can sometimes be found muttering "smash all computers" into a large glass of whisky. Martin Zaltz-Austwick ? musician, podcaster and lecturer in advanced spatial analysis at UCL ? recently composed a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thesoundoftheladies/youre-no-more-than-a-mile-from">slightly dystopic song</a> about smashing microchips to make sand for a giant fake beach (an allegory for the stupidity of much of modernity). </p><p>But the Guardian-GCHQ smash was not a simple matter of being frustrated with the various limitations mass-produced technology routinely puts upon us. Nor was it a "shoot the masters" matter of dismantling instruments of oppression. If anything, it was the masters doing the smashing, or at least directing it, and that's significant.</p><p>With the bicentennial, some Luddite fans have tried to rehabilitate and celebrate the movement as a symbol of people power for late modernity. A <a href="http://ludditebicentenary.blogspot.co.uk/">blog replays the historical events</a>; there's <a href="https://twitter.com/luddites200">an active and spiky Twitter account</a>. You'll increasingly see Luddites referenced at anti-roads or anti-GM protests. I haven't met an anti-fracking Luddite yet, but there's probably a few knocking about. Such neo-Luddites are rarely anti-technology. They tend to apply the term to challenge dominant views of progress with a focus on questioning who benefits from particular technological choice.</p><p>There are other ways we can take the Luddite story though, even without dismissing them as reactionary. David Edgerton, in his Nature essay <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v471/n7336/abs/471027a.html">In Praise of Luddism</a>, invited scientists to celebrate the inner Luddite and appreciate how much of their work involves the rejection of new ideas. It's not just scientists who do this. As Edgerton's book <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/aug/01/news.g2">The Shock of the Old</a> eloquently outlines, the history of technology is much more complex than a simple march of great machines. See, for example, <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-06/28/1897-electric-car">the 1897 electric cab</a> currently on display at the Science Museum.</p><p>An uneasy commonality runs through most approaches to the Luddite story; they tend to be used to invite us to think about the rejection of particular technologies. Rejection, that is, as opposed to the way our interactions with machines are usually a matter of compromise, negotiation, hybridisation and reinterpretation. To <a href="http://www.egs.edu/faculty/donna-haraway/articles/donna-haraway-a-cyborg-manifesto/">paraphrase Donna Haraway</a>, I think I'd rather be a cyborg than a Luddite. </p><p>There were echoes of King Ludd in some <a href="http://socialistworker.co.uk/art/34182/3D+Printers%3A+We+can%E2%80%99t+print+our+way+to+freedom+under+capitalism">recent Socialist Worker coverage of 3D printing</a>. The piece wanted to puncture hype surrounding 3D printing and stress that, for all that it might seem excitingly full of new possibilities for modes of production, the power of any new technology is most likely to be exploited by "the bosses". It concluded: "Unless we overthrow a system that reduces everything to the needs of profit, no technology will let us print our way to freedom." </p><p>There's an attractive purity to this message, but I find it ideologically reductive. As <a href="https://twitter.com/gsvoss/status/370125851779543040">Georgina Voss quipped</a>, "No <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pi</a> before the revolution." While it is undoubtedly true that the various opportunities offered by 3D printing ? like smart phones, the printing press or any number of innovations ? will serve the status quo long before they undo it, that doesn't mean such technologies can't also be used to fight the power too. We can use and appreciate the power of a technology while also remaining cognisant of the ways it (and the social structure it sits within) may disempower, even harm, us and people we love. It's messy and involves compromise and negotiation; but social change is messy. As Rusbridger commented under <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/19/david-miranda-schedule7-danger-reporters">his piece on Monday evening</a>: "Smashing up computers turns out to be quite messy."</p><p>Above all, perhaps, one of the reasons the destruction of this bit of Guardian computer equipment is significant is that the materials themselves didn't really mean much; there were copies of the files in America and Brazil. In that respect, maybe it reflects the Socialist Worker's view that it's always a larger system at play. </p><p>If I was feeling hyperbolic, I might be tempted to declare this moment a mirror image of the Luddites taking hammers to looms; a rather sad smash where those in power rather fitfully demanded a somewhat pointless destruction. But it's not a sign that we've finally wrested the power of technology from our masters any more than it's an example of the Guardian meekly doing GCHQ's bidding. Indeed, that information can exist in more than one place ? our digital fingerprints ? and, moreover, that people may be disempowered by this, sits at the basis of the whole NSA files affair. The Guardian's smashed hard drives are probably just a moment of strategic compromise in an ongoing struggle. Or maybe the initial leaking was the real smash. I don't know. </p><p><em>Alice Bell is a research fellow at the <a href="http://sussex.ac.uk/spru/">Science Policy Research Unit</a>, University of Sussex.

According to the Luddite Bicentenary Twitter account, this is far from the truth. In fact, Mellor's dissection was actually part of his punishment. Mellor, along with William Thorpe and Thomas Smith, had no say over what happened to his remains, as they dissected to prevent trouble/ martyr status. You can read the Bicentenary's <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/30/unthinkable-the-luddite-fallacy#comment-13924455">comment on the 2011 Guardian editorial</a> about this, and I can recommend their blogposts on the <a href="http://ludditebicentenary.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/6th-january-1813-trial-of-mellor-thorpe_6.html">sentencing</a> and <a href="http://ludditebicentenary.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/8th-january-1812-execution-of-george.html">execution</a> of Mellor, Thorpe and Smith. Dissection was <a href="http://ludditebicentenary.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/26th-december-1812-general-acland-gives.html">formally proposed on Boxing Day 1812</a> (a fortnight before the trial) by the Military - "I conceive the bodies may be convey'd to the Infirmary at Leeds for dissection, it will be most acceptable to the Medical Practitioners there" - but it was actually <a href="http://ludditebicentenary.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/26th-december-1812-general-acland-gives.html">the Treasury Solicitor's idea</a> 12 days prior to that, concerned the bodies might be "triumphantly buried by their Friends." Thanks to the Luddite Bicentenary site for that. A cautionary tale to those who try to mess with the machines of our masters and an rather sad example of military and medicine working together against dissent. Fascinating. </p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/science-policy">Science policy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files">The NSA files</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/gchq">GCHQ</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/uksecurity">UK security and counter-terrorism</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/terrorism">Counter-terrorism policy</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alice-bell">Alice Bell</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But that is what the cognitive scientist and linguist Steven Pinker has tried to do. In an essay for the New Republic entitled "<a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/114127/science-not-enemy-humanities" title="">Science Is Not the Enemy of the Humanities</a>", Pinker's target for forcible linguistic re?education is the term "scientism".</p><p>"Scientism" describes the practice of&nbsp;making wildly inflated claims for what modern science is able to explain, while denigrating other modes of understanding. For instance, popularisers of neuroscience who claim that it can solve the mystery of&nbsp;who we&nbsp;really are have no scientific basis for&nbsp;such claims. They are overreaching and&nbsp;indulging in false advertising. That&nbsp;is what I and others have called "neuroscientism", a discipline-specific subset of scientism in general.</p><p>Pinker affects to not quite understand this usage. "The term 'scientism' is anything but clear," he complains, "more of a boo-word than a&nbsp;label for&nbsp;any coherent doctrine ? The definitional vacuum allows me to replicate gay activists' flaunting of 'queer' and appropriate the pejorative for a position I am prepared to defend."</p><p>Let us pass over in a kind silence Pinker's reference to "flaunting" by "gay activists". What does he want "scientism" to mean instead? Two ideas: that "the world is intelligible", and that "the acquisition of knowledge is hard". That's one in the eye for all those critics of scientism who believe, somehow simultaneously, both that we can never understand anything about the world, and that acquiring knowledge is easy.</p><p>Pinker's claim that the word "scientism" currently floats melancholically in a "definitional vacuum" will come as a surprise to lexicographers. Dictionaries have quite&nbsp;substantial entries on it. The earliest citation in the OED is from the preface to George Bernard Shaw's play <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/13084/pg13084.html" title=""><em>Back to&nbsp;Methuselah</em></a>. Instructively, the word is&nbsp;here deployed by a man who is&nbsp;defending science and attacking religion. "Let the churches ask themselves why there is no revolt against the dogmas of mathematics though there is one against the dogmas&nbsp;of religion," Shaw writes. "It is&nbsp;not that science is free from legends, witchcraft, miracles, biographic boostings of quacks as heroes and saints, and of barren scoundrels as explorers and discoverers. On the contrary, the iconography and hagiology of scientism are as copious as they are mostly squalid." Here, Shaw uses "scientism" to indicate a kind of cultish puffery quite familiar from our modern promoters of the "iconography" of brain scans.</p><p>Later, "scientism" also denoted an overweening science envy in other disciplines. The philosopher of science&nbsp;Karl Popper explained this usage in his&nbsp;1970 essay "On the Theory of the Objective Mind". There he says (presumably unaware of Shaw's earlier use) that the word "originally" meant "the slavish imitation of the method and language of 'natural science', especially by social scientists; it was introduced in this sense by Hayek in his 'Scientism and the Study of Society'". (Popper himself defines it rather as "the aping of what is widely <em>mistaken</em> for the method of science". The mistake ? widespread, he laments, among historians ? is to copy the "alleged but non-existent method" of&nbsp;"collecting observations and then 'drawing conclusions' from them". This is impossible because what counts&nbsp;as evidence is theory-driven: "you can neither collect observations nor documentary evidence if you do not first have a problem".)</p><p>Perhaps this earlier meaning of "scientism" helps us to understand Pinker's complaint better. After all, his&nbsp;essay begins by suggesting that a&nbsp;little "21st-century freshman science" would have helped correct the blunderings of titanic Enlightenment philosophers such as Kant, and it ends&nbsp;by promising present-day humanities scholars that they have a&nbsp;bright future ahead if only they will use "behavioral genetics" to interpret "biography and memoir", or apply "data science" to "musical scores". In&nbsp;other words, as you might say, they should slavishly imitate the methods of the natural sciences.</p><p>Pinker's essay poses as a gesture of&nbsp;reconciliation between the two cultures, but is really a thinly veiled demand for total surrender by non-scientists. It thus perpetuates the idea that science and the humanities are hermetically distinct entities. Popper had already lost patience with this notion long ago. "Science, after all, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;branch of literature; and working on science is a human activity like building a cathedral," he wrote. "Labouring the difference between science and the humanities has long been a fashion, and has become a bore." It's entirely possible that Pinker&nbsp;would not have held his interest&nbsp;for too long either.</p><p>So perhaps "scientism" is not such a&nbsp;useless word after all. Indeed, in both&nbsp;its modern sense, when Pinker claims that science could have solved Kant's and Spinoza's philosophical difficulties, and in its older Hayek and&nbsp;Popper sense, when he calls for the&nbsp;humanities to become more science-based, Pinker's essay is&nbsp;itself a&nbsp;textbook exercise in&nbsp;scientism. No doubt he,&nbsp;as a linguist, is entirely aware of this pleasing&nbsp;irony.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/steven-pinker">Steven Pinker</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/language">Language</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/stevenpoole">Steven Poole</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Although a group at the Nobel Institute for Physics in Stockholm first reported their discovery of this element, the Berkeley team was given priority because their research was officially classified at the time of their discovery. Of course, priority meant they got to name this element. They chose to name it in honour of the recently deceased physicist Enrico Fermi, the developer of the first man-made nuclear reactor. </p><p></p><p>Fermium is notable because it is the heaviest element that can be created in a nuclear reactor. This means that we can, in theory, actually create large enough quantities that it would be visible to the naked eye. In the past, fermium had been detected -- fleetingly -- in the fallout from nuclear weapons tests (such as in the aftermath of those tests on Enewetak Atoll), in nuclear reactors, and after nuclear accidents. At this time, only a few milligrams are created in a year, so we don't know what it looks like, although it is predicted to be a silver-coloured metal -- no surprise there! </p><p>There are 19 isotopes known, none of which last very long once they come into existence -- the longest lived isotope is fermium-257, with a half-life of just 100.5 days. This makes fermium very unstable and intensely radioactive. Thus, its properties remain mysterious. For these reasons, fermium is of no interest whatsoever to most scientists -- even physicists and chemists have not identified any uses for this element. Taken together, fermium is the most boring element that I've told you about so far. </p><p>Here's two of our favourite chemistry professors telling us more about fermium:</p><p>[<a href="http://youtu.be/SQhI52sqanA">Video link</a>]</p><p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p><p>Video journalist <a href="http://periodicvideos.blogspot.com/">Brady Haran</a> is the man with the camera and the <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/">University of Nottingham</a> is the place with the chemists.

Only 2% of its mass came from the other chemical elements, such as iron, oxygen and silicon.</p><p>This meant that the sun had a radically different composition from the Earth, which is deficient in hydrogen and helium. At the time, however, scientists had thought that the Earth and the sun were very similar.</p><p>When she showed an early draft of her thesis to her supervisor, Harlow Shapely, he was so stunned by the result that he sent it to a colleague for a second opinion. The verdict came back that the result was impossible, although no error could be found in Payne's calculations. </p><p>To protect her reputation, she inserted a clause stating that the results were "probably not real". She need not have worried.</p><p>Within a matter of years, she was proven correct. Her work laid the entire foundation for our detailed understanding of the chemical composition of the stars. It is the astrophysical equivalent of Darwin's Origin of the Species in that it clearly sets out a theoretical framework for understanding the myriad types of stars and their different observational properties.</p><p>Her name was chosen for the undergarment in a popular vote on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whomadeyourpants">Who Made Your Pants? Facebook page</a>. Customers were offered a choice between Cecilia, cell donor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks">Henrietta Lacks</a> and astronaut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Ride">Sally Ride</a>.</p><p>Becky John, who runs the company, and is also an organiser of the <a href="http://winchesterscifest.org/">Winchester Science Festival</a> says, "We will always name our pants after women who have been forgotten."</p><p>Considering the magnitude of Payne's impact on astrophysics, it is strange that not more people know her name. In a recent blog post, Kash Farooq from the <a href="http://poddelusion.co.uk/blog/">Pod Delusion</a>, wondered why there isn't a space telescope yet <a href="http://thethoughtstash.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/why-isnt-there-a-space-telescope-named-after-cecilia-payne/">named after her</a>. It is a fair point to make. At least she now has a pair of pants.</p><p>Believe it or not, Payne herself wrote about the importance of appropriate undergarments in her <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cecilia-Payne-Gaposchkin-Autobiography-Other-Recollections/dp/0521483905 ">autobiography</a>.</p><p>Having moved from stuffy old England, where she was finding it impossible to progress her interest in astronomy, she settled at Harvard in the US. </p><p>In the ladies' dormitory, Cecilia was initially shocked at the way her fellow students "ran around in all stages of dishabille" in the dormitory. She goes on to recount: "When they found that I wore layer upon layer of underwear, they used to watch me disrobe with shrieks of incredulous delight. It was not long before their laughter, and the climate, weaned me from my native wardrobe. To dress like the other girls conveyed yet another sense of freedom."</p><p>Cecilia Payne added Gaposchkin to her name after she married.</p><p>The Cecilia pants are <a href="http://www.whomadeyourpants.co.uk/pages/shop">launched today</a> and I find myself wondering whether a similar idea could work for men? After all, what self-respecting alpha male wouldn't want to wear a pair of pants emblazoned with "Extremely Large Telescope"?</p><p><em><a href="http://www.stuartclark.com">Stuart Clark</a> is the author of <a href="http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846972478">The Day Without Yesterday</a> (Polygon).

We buy insurance to protect our investments in homes and cars. For those of us who don't have universal health care, most purchase health insurance. We don't like taking the chance - however remote - that we could be left unprepared in the event that something bad happens to our homes, cars, or health.</p><p>Climate change seems to be a major exception to this rule. Managing the risks posed by climate change is not a high priority for the public as a whole, despite the fact that a climate catastrophe this century is a very real possibility, and that such an event would have adverse impacts on all of us.</p><p>For example, in my job as an environmental risk assessor, if a contaminated site poses a cancer risk to humans of more than 1-in-10,000 to 1-in-1 million, that added risk is deemed unacceptably high and must be reduced. This <a href="http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancerbasics/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer">despite the fact that</a> an American man has a nearly 1-in-2 chance of developing and 1-in-4 chance of dying from cancer (1-in-3 and 1-in-5 for an American woman, respectively). </p><p>To that 42 percent chance of an average American developing cancer in his or her lifetime, we're unwilling to add another 0.001 percent. The reason is simple - we really, really don't want cancer, and thus consider even a small added risk unacceptable.</p><p>Yet we don't share that aversion to the risks posed by human-caused climate change. <a href="http://skepticalscience.com/climate-best-to-worst-case-scenarios.html">These risks include</a> more than half of global species potentially being at risk of extinction, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/aug/21/climate-change-extreme-heat">extreme weather like heat waves</a> becoming more commonplace, global food supplies put at risk by this more frequent extreme weather, glaciers and their associated water resources for millions of people disappearing, rising sea levels inundating coastlines, and so forth. </p><p>This isn't some slim one-in-a-million risk; we're looking at seriously damaging climate consequences in the <em><strong>most likely</strong></em>, <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/graphics.php?g=88">business-as-usual</a> scenario. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/aug/19/global-waring-ipcc-ar5-report">The forthcoming fifth IPCC report</a> is likely to state with 95 percent confidence that humans are the main drivers of climate change over the past 60 years, and <a href="http://skepticalscience.com/wigley-santer-2012-attribution.html">the scientific basis behind this confidence is quite sound</a>. It's the result of<a href="http://skepticalscience.com/graphics.php?g=57"> virtually every study</a> that has investigated the causes of global warming.</p><p>Yet <a href="http://www.capradio.org/news/npr/story?storyid=213894792">in a recent interview with NPR</a>, climate scientist Judith Curry, who has <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/certainty-monster-vs-uncertainty-ewok.html">a reputation for exaggerating climate science uncertainties</a>, claimed that based on those uncertainties,</p><blockquote><p>"I can't say myself that [doing nothing] isn't the best solution."</p></blockquote><p>This argument, made frequently by climate contrarians, displays a lack of understanding about risk management. I'm uncertain if I'll ever be in a car accident, or if my house will catch fire, or if I'll become seriously ill or injured within the next few years. That uncertainty won't stop me from buying auto, home, and health insurance. It's just a matter of prudent risk management, making sure we're prepared if something bad happens to something we value. That principle should certainly apply to the global climate.</p><p>Uncertainty simply isn't our friend when it comes to risk. If uncertainty is large, it means that a bad event might not happen, but it also means that we can't rule out the possibility of a catastrophic event happening. Inaction is only justifiable if we're certain that the bad outcome won't happen. </p><p>Curry is essentially arguing that she's not convinced we should take action to avoid what she believes is a very possible climate catastrophe. That's a failure of risk management. I wonder if she would also advise her children not to buy home or auto or health insurance. Maybe they'll be a wasted expense, or maybe they'll prevent financial ruin in the event of a catastrophe.</p><p>Climate change presents an enormous global risk, not in an improbable one-in-a-million case, but rather in the most likely scenario. From a risk management perspective, our choice could not be clearer. We should be taking serious steps to reduce our impact on the climate via fossil fuel consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions. But we're not. This is in large part due to a lack of public comprehension of the magnitude of the risk we face; a perception problem that social scientists are trying to determine how to overcome.</p><p>At the moment, climate change looks like humanity's greatest-ever risk management failure. Hopefully we'll remedy that failure before we commit ourselves to catastrophic climate consequences that we're unprepared to face.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change">Climate change</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-change-scepticism">Climate change scepticism</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange">Climate change</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/dana-nuccitelli">Dana Nuccitelli</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

His parachute would have saved his life but another fault meant the main chute failed to open.</p><p>The 35-year-old was airlifted to hospital following the incident on 8 November 2011 but he was pronounced dead.</p><p>Tom Kark QC, representing the pilot's family, told the hearing at Lincoln Cathedral Centre on Thursday that his clients wanted to know what had previously been done to address the fault with the Hawk T1 seat firing handle, the BBC reported.</p><p>"Obviously, on behalf of the family, they would like the widest exploration possible of why their son and brother died," Kark said.</p><p>He added that the family also wanted to know what action had been taken to prevent other pilots being put "in a similar dangerous position".</p><p>The fault with the parachute related to the shackle linking the seat and the drogue parachute ? a smaller chute deployed before the main one. The drogue parachute opened but the main one failed to.</p><p>The full inquest into the incident is due to start on 9 January and is expected to last three weeks. It is expected to hear evidence from 40 witnesses, including an expert on ejector seats.</p><p>The fatal incident was captured on video but the "distressing" footage might not be shown.</p><p>Lincolnshire police investigated the death but the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to pursue criminal charges.</p><p>The Health and Safety Executive is investigating and will make recommendations after the completion of the full inquest. The incident bewildered senior RAF officers who say the ejector seat in a Hawk is almost impossible to activate accidentally, requiring considerable pressure from the pilot. The parachute should have opened regardless. Cunningham was an experienced pilot with an exemplary record, who had flown in the Iraq war on close air-support missions for British and US ground troops.</p><p>After his death the MoD implemented a temporary ban on non-essential flying in aircraft with ejector seats similar to those in the Hawk T1. The Red Arrows have used the dual-control BAE Systems Hawk T1, which has a top speed of Mach 1.2, since 1979.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/royal-air-force">Royal Air Force</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/aeronautics">Aeronautics</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/military">Military</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidbatty">David Batty</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It said the training, "which involves shooting, stabbing and breaking the bones of live pigs and other animals", breaks an EU directive that animals must not be used when other options are available.</p><p>The Ministry of Defence uses a Danish facility twice a year to train army doctors in battlefield surgery and insists the handling of the animals is rigorously controlled and they are heavily anaesthetised throughout and attended by veterinary staff. In a letter to the European Commission director-general for environment, Karl Falkenberg, PETA claims the militaries of 22 of the 28 Nato nations, including 19 other EU states, are currently using exclusively non-animal trauma training models such as life-like human-patient simulators, manikins and hospital rounds.</p><p>"The UK's Defence Medical Services and the militaries of Denmark, Norway and Poland continue to mutilate and kill live animals during medical training exercises even though each country has similar domestic laws banning the use of animals when other options exist," it said in a statement, claiming such action violated directive 2010/63/EU/. "PETA is asking Falkenberg to enforce the directive against these four countries."</p><p>The MoD said: "This training provides invaluable experience, exposing our surgical teams to the specific challenges posed by the injuries of modern armed conflict. It has helped save lives on operations and by participating in the Danish exercises we minimise the overall number of animals used.</p><p>"Where simulation can be used for training we do so. However, at the moment for pre-deployment surgical trauma training simulation does not meet the training requirement."</p><p>The MoD says it would not be illegal to carry out similar training in the UK, although Home Office approval would be needed on a case-by-case basis. By participating in the Danish exercises, instead of replicating them in the UK, it said it was minimising the overall number of animals used. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2234625/Were-going-damage-lot-pigs-livers-Horrific-boast-battlefield-doctors-shoot-operate-injured-animals-Nato-base-NHS-surgeons-practice.html" title="">Details of the training emerged </a> when it was reported that 18 pigs were shot on the Definitive Surgical and Trauma Care course at Nato's Jaegerspris training area. After being fired upon in a manner intended to damage the pigs' organs but prevent imminent death, the animals were then treated as casualties, carried into ambulances and driven to a surgical theatre and operated on by a team of six medics, the Mail on Sunday reported.</p><p>Among those who have written to the MoD to protest is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/10/homeland-writer-mod-pig-surgery" title="">Gideon Raff,</a> the creator of the hit TV series <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/homeland?guni=Article:in%20body%20link" title="">Homeland</a>.</p><p>In its letter, PETA said the Danish Armed Forces had described in a paper "how it shoots live pigs with high-velocity bullets and inflicts life-threatening multi-organ injuries and bone fractures on the animals during this training, which is also attended by the UK's Defence Medical Services".</p><p>Though Norway is not a member of the EU, the directive is marked as relevant to the European Economic Area (EEA) of which it is a member, and therefore must comply, said PETA.</p><p>"This is not a choice between saving animals and saving human beings - instead it's about using modern and effective simulation tools that will better train medical personnel to save lives on the battlefield," said Mimi Bekhechi, PETA associate director. "If nearly 80% of the UK's NATO allies - including 19 EU member states - rely on superior non-animal training methods, so can the UK, Denmark, Norway and Poland."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/animal-welfare">Animal welfare</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/medical-research">Medical research</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/military">Military</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I am a female. Given the way that I feel, and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible. I hope that you will support me in this transition."</p><p>But Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas, where Manning is due to serve out her sentence, said on Thursday that it would not provide trans treatment beyond psychiatric support, in a move criticised as unconstitutional by activists and LGBT groups.</p><p>Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison on Wednesday for leaking hundreds of thousands of classified documents. She was found guilty of 20 counts, six of them under the Espionage Act, but her lawyers argued during the trial that Manning was acting out of a sense of duty to her country.</p><p>"I also request that, starting today, you refer to me by my new name and use the feminine pronoun (except in official mail to the confinement facility)," Manning's statement read. "I look forward to receiving letters from supporters and having the opportunity to write back."</p><p>She thanked her supporters for helping to "keep me strong" during her arrest and trial and for funding her defense.</p><p>During her trial it emerged that Manning had emailed a picture of herself, wearing a long blonde wig and lipstick, to her supervisor. In the subject line Manning had written: "My Problem".</p><p>Manning's lawyers argued that this was an example of how the soldier's supervisors failed her on numerous occasions and contributed to the stress she was under.</p><p>"The stress that [she] was under was mostly to give context to what was going on at the time," Manning's lawyer, David Coombs, told NBC's Today show on Thursday.</p><p>"It was never an excuse because that's not what drove [her] actions. What drove [her] actions was a strong moral compass."</p><p>Manning has already spent three and a half years in prison awaiting trial. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/08/bradley-manning-112-day-reduction-possible-sentence">Her sentence was reduced by 112 days in January</a> after a judge ruled she had been subjected to excessively harsh treatment in military detention.</p><p>Coombs has confirmed that Manning will spend her sentence at Fort Leavenworth military prison, however a spokeswoman for the prison said this week that treatment for inmates at the prison does not include hormone therapy.</p><p>"All inmates are considered soldiers and are treated as such with access to mental health professionals, including a psychiatrist, psychologist, social workers and behavioral science noncommissioned officers with experience in addressing the needs of military personnel in pre- and post-trial confinement," <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2013/08/20/60451.htm">Kimberly Lewis told Courthouse News Service</a>.</p><p>"The army does not provide hormone therapy or sex-reassignment surgery for gender identity disorder."</p><p>Coombs said on Thursday that he is "hoping" that Fort Leavenworth "would do the right thing" and provide hormone therapy.</p><p>"If Fort Leavenworth does not, then I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure they are forced to do so."</p><p>Trans and civil liberties groups said it would be "unconstitutional" for Fort Leavenworth not to give Manning treatment.</p><p>"This is the United States. We do not deny medical treatment to prisoners," said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National National Center for Transgender Equality.</p><p>"It is illegal, it's unconstitutional. That is fairly settled law under the eighth amendment against cruel and unusual punishment. The medical community is now unified that transition-related care is legitimate medical care that can successfully treat a serious underlying condition."</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union said Manning had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and should receive hormone therapy. Statements by Fort Leavenworth to the contrary raise "serious constitutional concerns", <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanjreilly/status/370575902406488064/photo/1">said Chase Strangio</a>, an attorney with the union's LGBT project. </p><p>"The official policy of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and most state agencies is to provide medically necessary care for the treatment of gender dysphoria, and courts have consistently found that denying such care to prisoners based on blanket exclusions violates the eighth amendment of the constitution."</p><p>Aside from the issue of treatment, Keisling said there was a "systemic problem" with how the justice system treats trans people, who she said face a "heightened amount of sexual assault" in both federal and military prisons. </p><p>"Trans people tend to be treated unfairly in terms of arrests, in terms of prosecution, in terms of conviction, sentencing and their time in jails and prison. It's a dramatically serious problem that Americans don't know about."<br /> <br />Trans prisoners should undergo an "individualised assessment", she said, to determine how they should be incarcerated.</p><p>"It is a much more complicated than trans women should be in women's prisons and trans men should be in men's prisons. </p><p>"They should take into account what will be more safe for the prisoner. They need to look at things like a prisoners' past history of being a victim or of victimising other people. </p><p>"They need to look at the person's self-assessment of where they would be safe. They need to look at a person's gender identity, they need to look at a person's sexual orientation."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/chelsea-manning">Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning)</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa">United States</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gender">Gender</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/psychology">Psychology</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-military">US military</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-national-security">US national security</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/adam-gabbatt">Adam Gabbatt</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But for organisations like the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a>, <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Education-resources/Education-and-learning/index.htm">involved in science education</a>, there's another story in the mix.<br /> <br /><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/aug/15/a-level-results-fall-girls-top-marks">Last week's A-level results</a> showed that the healthy growth in numbers taking physics, chemistry and biology at A-level has continued for the fifth year running. Sciences now make up 17.8% of total UK A-level entries, up from 17.0% in 2012. This is important if the national shortage of people with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields">Stem skills</a> ? <a href="http://www.smf.co.uk/media/news/economic-rebalancing-be-thwarted-40000-annual-science-gradua/">estimated to be 40,000 graduates per year by the Social Market Foundation</a> ? is to be overcome. But the results also showed a worrying widening of the gender gap: the number of boys taking A-level physics rose by 3.9%, but for girls the rise was only 0.2%.</p><p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/aug/22/gcse-results-2013-science-grades-fall">In this week's GCSE results</a>, we see continued growth in the numbers taking each of the separate sciences: physics is up by 2.1% on 2012, chemistry by 4.4% and biology by 5.0%. This bodes well for the future of these subjects. It is true that grades have fallen, as a result of the exam regulator Ofqual's moves to end grade inflation by "stabilising" standards at GCSE and A-level. This may seem hard on this year's candidates ? especially in science where 53.1% of pupils were awarded A* to C, down from 60.7% last year ? but it needed doing if these qualifications are to retain real value. </p><p>We are now in an era where GCSE and A level are effectively norm-referenced to give roughly the same proportion of each grade year-on-year. While this may not in itself affect the numbers taking each of the sciences, there may soon be another factor at work as a result of the proposed changes to school accountability systems. Today's GCSE results from Northern Ireland carry a warning.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/secondary-school-accountability-consultation">Department for Education has proposed a suite of new accountability measures for secondary schools</a> in England to go with the new GCSEs being introduced from 2015. The intention is to reduce the emphasis on the proportion of pupils getting five or more good GCSEs, which has led to some adverse behaviour by schools, such as concentrating efforts on boosting pupils at the C-D grade borderline. However, the new suite of measures being proposed is so complex that it is difficult to predict how schools will change their entry policies for science as they attempt to optimise their performance.</p><p>Under current arrangements, all pupils are expected to take a science course at GCSE that is balanced across physics, chemistry and biology. Most take either three separate science GCSEs or a "double award" science qualification which has balanced content across these three sciences. A small proportion take a "single award" qualification that is, again, balanced across the three sciences. </p><p>With the new, complex assessment and accountability arrangements from 2015, there is a risk that balanced science may no longer be the norm. We can be sure that school leaders will look at how they can optimise their school's performance in every subject, including science. Evidence from Northern Ireland suggests there may be a fall in the number of students taking a balance of all the science subjects.</p><p>Over the last five years, pupils in Northern Ireland have no longer been required to study a balance of all three science subjects at GCSE level, and can choose instead to take one, two or three qualifications in these subjects individually. This has led to a striking change in the distribution of science subjects studied. </p><p>In 2007, entries for biology, physics and chemistry GCSEs in Northern Ireland were spread evenly across subjects and genders. But this has changed: in 2013, 4,489 pupils sat biology, 54% of whom were female; 3,195 sat chemistry, 49% of whom were female; and 3,092 sat physics, 41% of whom were female. </p><p>The changes to assessment and accountability in England carry the risk that pupils at state-maintained schools may no longer take all three science subjects, leading to similar changes in the distribution of science studied, with falls in physics and chemistry and a growing gender divide.</p><p>It is important that all pupils have a balanced science course to age 16: physics, chemistry and biology are equally important for scientific literacy. Ministers now need to make it crystal clear that, whatever the complexities of the new accountability system, all pupils in England will be expected to follow a science course that includes elements of the three major sciences to the age of 16.</p><p><em><a href="http://royalsociety.org/people/john-holman/">Sir John Holman</a> is Senior Adviser for Education at the Wellcome Trust</em></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/science-policy">Science policy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/gcses">GCSEs</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-holman">John Holman</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"I discovered a two-pointed hoe at my family house on Mount Etna recently that was identical to one we found during a Roman excavation."</p><p>What has changed are the types of grape varieties, which have intermingled over the centuries. "Columella mentions 50 types but we can only speculate on the modern-day equivalents," said Indelicato, who is planting a local variety, Nerello Mascalese.</p><p>"To sweeten up their wine, which could be vinegary, the Romans added honey and water to it," he said. "They made better stuff for nobles and cheaper, more vinegary stuff for slaves. We will try and make both types."</p><p>The drinking habits of Romans have also changed in two millennia. Whereas Italians today drink moderately with meals, their ancestors were more given to drunken carousing.</p><p>"An edict was issued in the first century AD halting the planting of vineyards because people were not growing wheat any more," said Indelicato.</p><p>"The Romans took the concept of getting together for a drink from the Greeks after they conquered the Greek-controlled Italian city of Taranto in the third century BC.</p><p>"They drank at festivals to mark the pending harvest, after the harvest. In fact, any occasion was good for a drink."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/italy">Italy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wine">Wine</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/archaeology">Archaeology</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/virgil">Virgil</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/classics">Classics</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/tomkington">Tom Kington</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

When confronted with a choice between building a school or a weather station, public authorities often choose the former. In addition, a traditional weather station needs local availability of technically skilled staff, a significant problem ? especially in rural areas.</p><p>It is clear that new models of data collection are necessary that are ? technically, socio-economically, and financially ? more sustainable. To this end, Delft University of Technology is leading a public-private consortium, comprising 14 universities and several small and large businesses, to pioneer the <a href="http://www.tahmo.org" title="">Trans-African Hydro-Meteorological Observator</a>y (Tahmo) network .</p><p>Tahmo is committed to advancing open exchange of hydro-meteorological data from the network. All raw data collected will be freely available for scientific research and government use under the World Meteorological Organisation's <a href="http://www.wmo.int/pages/about/Resolution40.html)" title="">guidance</a>.</p><p>Excitingly, Tahmo offers the prospect of cost-effective hydro-meteorological measuring stations that are low maintenance. The stations will cost only $500, but will be technologically innovative by deploying low-cost sensors (as found in objects ranging from washing machines to cars and smart phones) marshalled to serve as weather or water sensors. For instance, the simple piezo buzzer (costing $1), which is used in fire alarms, will be used to measure rainfall intensity. Similarly, <a href="http://www.delta.tudelft.nl/article/come-to-think-of-it-smart-cheap-tags-for-plant-pots/21628" title="">RFID tags</a> ($0.10) will be used to measure soil moisture.</p><p>The Tahmo network will be made of 20,000 stations in sub-Saharan Africa; one at each point of a 35km grid. The stations will measure <a href="http://tahmo.info/current-african-climate-data" title="">standard variables</a>, such as air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, rainfall, and radiation. In addition, they will probably also measure lightning, soil moisture, and atmospheric dust. The stations will be robust, having no moving parts, and require near-zero maintenance.</p><p>Beyond providing free data to the public, the stations (which will most likely be based at secondary schools) will have wider socio-economic benefits for communities. A <a href="http://tahmo.info/free-tahmo-course-material-0" title="">curriculum is being developed</a> to teach children about weather, water, climate, measurement, and computing ? <a href="http://tahmo.info/educational" title="">small pilots</a> have already been developed by Delft University in Ghana and by IBM in Kenya. Schools will also receive, in addition to free teaching materials, a small fee ($200 per year) for station upkeep.</p><p>Central to the success of Tahmo is growing mobile phone coverage through Africa. This network allows for efficient payment of hosting fees through M-Pesa and similar schemes.</p><p>Mobile phones allow for raw communication of data to a central data repository. Sensors have already been electronically integrated by connecting them to a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" title="">Raspberry Pi computer</a>. In turn, the Raspberry Pi can send data over GPRS to a cloud-based interactive <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/us/en/intelligent-operations-center/" title="">data visualisation and management system</a>. Presently, 12 stations are running in Senegal, Ghana, South Africa, Kenya, and Uganda to test the robustness of this mode of communication.</p><p>This leaves the crucial question of guaranteeing that Tahmo can sustain itself financially. International donors and national governments have a role with start-up costs and institutional facilitation. But, in the long-term, the ambition is for the network to be self-sustaining financially ($5-7m per year). This means that the data collected must also have private sector application.</p><p>Already, IT businesses that provide farmers with information on commodity and input prices have expressed interest in adding weather-based information from Tahmo. Micro-insurance companies also have an obvious use for the data. Presently, such firms are running their own meteo-networks, which is sub-optimal ? both financially and from a legal perspective.</p><p>International companies will probably also be interested in obtaining data for hedging purposes for crops such as cotton, cocoa, and coffee. There will also be valuable information for hydropower generation, navigation, flood mitigation, and aviation industries.</p><p>Together with ideas platform, <a href="http://www.africagathering.org/" title="">Africa Gathering</a>, workshops were recently held in Accra and Dakar where young entrepreneurs brainstormed cost models and ways to add value to the gathered data. In September, two winning ideas will be rewarded with start-up grants.</p><p>The funding dimension is just one challenge to Tahmo succeeding in the ambition of constructing a network of 20,000 stations. However, it has real potential to serve as a model to provide Africa with essential weather, water, and climate data. If the creative energy generated so far by the students and young entrepreneurs is any measure of future success, there are grounds for real optimism.</p><p><em>Professor Nick van de Giesen is co-leader of the Tahmo project and Van Kuffeler chair of Water Resources Management at </em><a href="http://cookie.tudelft.nl/index.php?action=verify&origin=http://home.tudelft.nl/en/" title=""><em>Delft University of Technology.</em></a><em> Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/nvandegiesen" title=""><em>@nvandegiesen</em></a><em> on Twitter.</em></p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

In its opinion, three types of supplement ? Bioglan Probiotic capsules, Bimuno Prebiotic powder and Seven Seas Cardiomax ? "made unproven health claims on their packaging and websites". The packaging of the Bioglan and Bimuno products "make unproven claims relating to how they help maintain digestive health, such as 'helps maintain digestive balance'. These supplements don't contain any additional vitamins or minerals so don't actually have any approved health benefits," says the research.</p><p>The EU has rejected many examples of advertising designed to promote the idea that probiotic drinks help enhance the body's natural defences and boost the immune system, and all health claims of any sort related to prebiotic and probiotic drinks and tablets submitted for its approval by supplement-makers, Which? says.</p><p>It also found that six other food supplements "could confuse consumers with their exaggerated and ambiguous claims". All six have used the fact that they also contain another ingredient, such as Vitamin C or calcium, beyond the main one to claim that the product in its entirety has health benefits, whereas there is no evidence to show that the main ingredient confers that advantage.</p><p>The consumer group lists the six as Boots Digestion Support Plus, Bioglan Glucosamine Plus Chondroitin and MSM, Seven Seas Jointcare Active, Boots Joint Health Glucosamine Sulphate and Chondroitin, Vitabiotics Jointace Original and Optima ActivJuice for Joints. "Confused consumers are likely to think the benefits of these products come from the main ingredients as heavily advertised on the packaging, which could lead to people wasting money", Which? says.</p><p>For years claims made by supplement producers were not regulated. But for the last five years they have had to get the Efsa's approval for such claims. However, it has approved just 248 of the more than 44,000 such claims submitted for its endorsement.</p><p>While glucosamine supplements containing vitamin C can cost up to £1 a day, a multivitamin tablet ? also containing the same vitamin ? is on sale for as little as 3p a day. Consumers could save up to £354 a year by switching products, Which? calculates.</p><p>Similarly, in the case of prebiotics and probiotics, "you could include calcium-rich foods in your diet, such as milk, instead of spending 27p to 55p per day and up to £200 a year on this product [Boots Digestion Support Plus], which contains only 15% of your recommended daily allowance of calcium", says Which?.</p><p>The health supplements industry is estimated to be worth £385m a year. In a survey of 2,100 UK adults last month Which? found that a third of them said they regularly took at least one supplement. Almost one in five (18%) said they took glucosamine products and 14% use probiotics drinks and tablets.</p><p>"It's worrying that some manufacturers aren't playing fair on the packaging of food supplements, making claims which could leave shoppers out of pocket", said Richard Lloyd, the executive director of Which?. "Which? campaigned for health claims on these products to be backed up by scientific evidence, so it's disappointing that manufacturers are still using clever language to imply unproven benefits."</p><p>But the supplements industry rejected the claims made by Which?. "This new report regarding health claims on food supplements is inaccurate as it infers that manufacturers are misleading their customers, which is simply not true", said Graham Keen, executive director of the <a href="http://www.hfma.co.uk/" title="">Health Food Manufacturers' Association</a>.</p><p>"Just because a certain ingredient does not have an Efsa-approved claim does not mean that it doesn't have a beneficial effect. The report ignores the significant efforts by UK manufacturers to comply with the regulation as well as still provide factual information about what their products do and how they work", Keen said.</p><p>?

In high-pressure sports situations like this, we're often told to concentrate and "keep our eye on the ball". But while it sounds like great advice, research into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_(sensory)">eye movements</a> might disagree.</p><p>One of the fastest movements that the human body can make is with the eyes. When we move them to look at something that's grabbed our interest, that short, sharp, jerky movement is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade">saccade</a>, and on average we make about three of them every second. Eye movements are interesting, because they represent both the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21237189">first and last steps in seeing</a>. They're responsible for stabilising images that are transmitted to the brain against jitter caused by head movements, but they're also a response to our representation of the world; to information about plans, goals, interests and even expectations about future events. </p><p>So eye movements are useful to research because understanding how, why and where we move our eyes can provide us with information on how the brain goes about making decisions. But they also pose a problem in things like ball sports ? saccades take a certain amount of time to generate, so by the time you've decided to look at a ball, it will have already moved on. Say an eye movement takes about half a second to be programmed and executed, and a cricket ball is bowled at 70mph. In the time it takes to detect the ball and move your eyes to it, the ball will have travelled about 16 metres ? more than three-quarters the length of the pitch. So how do expert cricketers (or any other sports people, for that matter) get over this apparent difficulty and hit the ball so consistently well?</p><p>In 2001, Mike Land at the University of Sussex and Peter MacLeod at Oxford University <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11100157">attempted to answer just that</a>. They took three batters of differing skill levels and measured their eye movements while firing cricket balls at them from a bowling machine. What they found was that the batters would try to anticipate where the ball was going to be by making a saccade to the point of contact with the floor. In the case of the best batter, his eye movements were initiated a fifth of a second earlier than the worst batter's, meaning that he had more time to take in information about the ball's movement at the bounce point. In other words, expertise results in being able to predict more accurately where the cricket ball is going to be in the future.</p><p>So it's not the case that batters track the ball all the way through its flight. But do they watch it when it hits the bat? Until recently, the answer was thought to be a resounding "no" ? <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1984-30523-001">studies</a> looking at the interaction between the vision and the motor systems argued that it couldn't happen. But in a <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0058289">recent PLoS ONE paper</a>, David Mann and colleagues pointed out that this doesn't really sit well with anecdotal reports from world-class players who are adamant that they <em>do</em> see the ball when they hit it. </p><p>To investigate this properly, Mann and his team took two top batters, and recorded their head and eye movements while they hit balls delivered from a bowling machine in front of a projected video of a bowler. They found that the batters were able to synchronise their head movements with the trajectory of the ball incredibly precisely. The batters then made anticipatory eye movements towards their bat, so that they could see the moment the ball comes into contact with it. When the researchers looked at the eye and head movements of club-level players instead, they found that these batters weren't as accurate in being able to couple their head movements to the movement of the ball. They also weren't very good at making those anticipatory eye movements to see the ball come into contact with the bat. </p><p>All of these sorts of predictive movements provide the brain with more information about what's going on around you, which in turn gives you a little bit more time to prepare and adjust your own movements. In the case of expert cricketers, even having a few hundredths of a second to adjust the orientation of their wrists could mean the difference between a boundary and a catch. However, it's still not quite clear precisely why late information about the ball hitting the bat is useful. At any rate, the old adage is wrong ? don't keep your eye on the ball. Keep your eye on where the ball's going to be.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/neuroscience">Neuroscience</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/psychology">Psychology</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashes-2013-14">Ashes 2013-14</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket">Cricket</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/pete-etchells">Pete Etchells</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Michael Zuk, who bought Lennon's molar at a 2011 auction, has begun sequencing the former Beatle's DNA ? the first step in a process set out by scientists who propose to clone <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jul/31/woolly-mammoth-dna-cloning" title="">a woolly mammoth</a>.</p><p>"Many Beatles fans remember where they were when they heard John Lennon was shot. I hope they also live to hear the day he was given another chance," Zuk said. The tooth has already been couriered to an unnamed US lab where scientists are "considering ways to extract [its] genetic code". "I am nervous and excited at the possibility that we will be able to fully sequence John Lennon's DNA," Zuk said. "With researchers working on ways to clone mammoths, the same technology certainly could make human cloning a reality."</p><p>Two years ago the Red Deer-based dentist paid £19,500 for a "discoloured molar" that had been passed down by Lennon to his Weybridge housekeeper, Dot Jarlett. It was acquired in the mid-60s, and Jarlett's son said it had "been in the family ever since". At the time of the sale, Omega auction house claimed the tooth was "too fragile" for DNA testing.</p><p>Nevertheless, Zuk denies that he has bitten off more than he can chew. With new advances in genetic research, he believes that Lennon's DNA can be harvested and, in time, converted from tissue cells into stem cells, and eventually into a reborn Beatle. "To say I had a small part in bringing back one of rock's greatest stars would be mind-blowing," he said.</p><p>In the meantime, Zuk is promoting his other dental endeavours: <a href="http://www.johnlennontooth.com/John_Lennon_DNA_Pendant.html" title="">pendants</a> and a <a href="http://www.johnlennontooth.com/Charity_Initiative.html" title="">sculpture</a> made from Lennon's "tooth dust", a photo book of celebrity <a href="http://www.johnlennontooth.com/-Rot_Star__Art.html" title="">champers</a>, the parody song <a href="http://www.johnlennontooth.com/" title="">Love Me Tooth</a>, and other initiatives to promote awareness of mouth cancer.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/johnlennon">John Lennon</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/cloning">Cloning</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock">Pop and rock</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/genetics">Genetics</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles">The Beatles</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa">United States</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/dentists">Dentists</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/seanmichaels">Sean Michaels</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Family matters probably play a major role ? and I'm about to see for myself just what havoc a baby can wreak</p><p>Although I'm a research biologist, I work closely with an NHS clinic in the company of a lively band of doctors and nurses. I suspect they're as fascinated by my mucking about with test tubes, stains and microscopes as I am by their patient exams and diagnoses. But it wasn't until I belatedly stumbled over <a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2013.63.1.9#.UhPS6FOyeQM">a fascinating paper</a> from a Canadian scholar, published earlier this year, that another key difference became clear.</p><p>There <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8077083.stm">isn't a huge gender imbalance amongst physicians</a> ? in the UK about 40% are women, and projections suggest they will be the majority in a few years. Other countries show a similar pattern. </p><p>This situation contrasts sharply with academic biology, where for decades roughly equal numbers of women and men have embarked upon that career path, only to end up with<a href="http://www.theukrc.org/files/useruploads/files/final_sept_15th_15.42_ukrc_statistics_guide_2010.pdf"> a small minority of female professors</a> ? a trend reflected globally. It's such a problem that a <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/inquiries/parliament-2010/women-in-stem-careers/">Commons Select Committee is currently calling for evidence</a> about the "leaky pipeline" for women in science, technology, engineering and maths.</p><p>I've <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2012/sep/25/2">written before about this topic</a>, as have many others. The gender difference between science and medicine, however, is something I've noticed but have never really stopped to wonder about. Perhaps I've been too preoccupied stressing about where my next short-term contract will come from, as my female colleagues drop like flies around me (and my male colleagues quietly get tenure). </p><p>The reasons for gender imbalance in the sciences are undoubtedly complex and multifactorial. <a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1525/bio.2013.63.1.9#.UhPS6FOyeQM">The Canadian paper</a>, which focuses mostly on the situation in North America but is comparable to the UK, hypothesises and provides compelling evidence that one main reason academic science is less populated with women than is medicine ? despite both starting with nearly equal numbers of trainees ? is not that it's more stressful, lower-paid, requires longer hours ? or is even less "family friendly" overall. Rather, it's that the most competitive time in each career differs sharply. For medicine, the bulk of the competition occurs during the fight to get into medical school ? this happens before most people start families. Once in, you're pretty much guaranteed a job at the other end, as intake is sensibly regulated with a view towards supply and demand. On the other hand, in academia, while it's relatively easy to get into graduate school, the steepest competition ? getting one's first faculty position ? coincides with peak childbearing years. And with the sharp career pyramid structure in academic science, in which cheap disposable trainees perform the vast bulk of scientific research, only a tiny fraction of PhD students will ultimately get jobs in academia (<a href="http://royalsociety.org/policy/publications/2010/scientific-century/">about 4% in the UK</a>), making that competition even fiercer. </p><p>It's an interesting hypothesis, and the entire paper, by Professor Shelley Adamo, is available free of charge if you want to know more. Presumably it could very well apply to other careers where pivotal milestones occur during peak childbearing. </p><p>But such musings are no longer abstract for me. I am currently eight months' pregnant with my first baby, and have been for several years lodged firmly in a grey zone between an independent research post and a tenured one. Competition, I can report from the front line, is indeed intense ? it's pipettors at dawn, with everyone scrambling over the small scraps of grant funding available. </p><p>There are, however, other career-negative factors that I never truly considered until I was in this position. And I don't just mean being unable to button up my white coat. The whole experience has been psychologically fraught in a way that I had never envisaged.</p><p>Take the first three months, before I felt comfortable telling anyone about the pregnancy. I had to eat constantly to keep the nausea at bay, which didn't always work during an intense experiment when I was unable to leave my test tubes unattended. (Although many health and safety rules in the lab are over-the-top, not eating amidst toxic chemicals and pathogenic bacteria probably isn't one of them.) I don't think my productivity dropped, but it was extremely unpleasant. Then as I started to show ? not so easy to hide from my colleagues, the majority of whom are obstetricians or gynaecologists ? I agonised about when and how to confess to my two (male) bosses. I use the word "confess" deliberately, because I felt a keen sense of guilt, as if I were betraying their trust, somehow disrespecting their decision to hire me. Rationally I knew that I was only planning on taking four months of maternity leave, and that I have a legal and human right to procreate. But somehow the guilt was overwhelming, so much so that I often lay awake at night feeling physically sick imagining how the conversations might go. I wasn't even sure at that point, with my contract soon to expire, that I was eligible for occupational maternity pay.</p><p>Another worry, given my contract's looming demise, was that it would be impossible to seek employment elsewhere once I started to show. Who would hire a newly pregnant woman if they could get someone else who would not drop out again a few months later? And then after giving birth, would I fall behind during maternity leave and the inevitable adjustment period when I went back to work? Would I publish fewer papers, which would mean a less competitive CV for securing those already impossible to get grants? Would my international competitors pip me to the post on key projects?</p><p>Thankfully, a lot of my worries to date have turned out to be unfounded. Although I almost had a heart attack broaching the topic, both of my bosses seemed genuinely delighted at my news, and remain extremely supportive of my long-term career. The university turns out to have a wonderful maternity policy that does not discriminate against open-ended or short-term contracts. My current grant will be frozen in my absence, so the relentless clock will stop while I'm up to my elbows in nappies instead of test tubes ? meaning I don't have to job-hunt just yet. I've recently had a few promising funding leads for the future. And though I don't think it will be a piece of cake getting back into the swing of things, I benefit from the inspiration of a number of new-mum colleagues who have managed to make it seem, if not easy, then at least doable.</p><p>All of this uncertainty is helped tremendously by how much I love science in general, and my research project in particular. The work is important and fulfilling, the experiments have been successful, and every morning I open the lab door dying to know what results the team will come up with that day. I can't imagine ever doing anything else.</p><p>So bring on the biggest experiment I've probably ever conducted in my life. I'm ready.</p><p><hr /></p><p>Jenny Rohn is a cell biologist at University College London, looking forward to being a yummy mummy in September.

Although the College of Physicians of Philadelphia also has an exceptional medical library, I visited as a tourist rather than a professional historian of medicine, and went round their museum of anatomical specimens and other medical artifacts.</p><p>The banner outside claims the museum is 'Disturbingly Informative', and there's no doubt it relies in part on morbid curiosity to get people through the doors to see a <a href="http://scienceline.org/2013/01/a-rich-life-among-the-dead/">fraction of its enormous collection</a> of body parts (pickled, dried, and modelled in wax), surgical instruments and other paraphernalia from the history of medicine. The more extraordinary exhibits seem to get the most attention, such as the preserved foetuses in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratology">teratology</a> collection, the <a href="http://www.muttermuseumstore.com/merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=MutterMuseumStore&Product_Code=000043&Category_Code=PC">extremely tall and extremely short skeletons</a>, the <a href="http://anthony-demarco.blogspot.co.uk/2010/02/giant-colon.html">eight foot long megacolon</a>, or the <a href="http://bonesdontlie.wordpress.com/2011/01/16/the-soap-man-and-lady-revisited/">soap-lady</a>. </p><p>The ethics of displaying human body parts are complicated; in the UK this practice is limited by the Human Tissue Act of 2004, brought in after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alder_Hey_organs_scandal">Alder Hay tissue retention scandal</a>. This Act places restrictions on what can be displayed, particularly when it comes to bodies and <a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/10032#.UhHnEr-BZLs">bodies and parts taken from other countries</a>, and has been the subject of a lot of (<a href="http://egyptmanchester.wordpress.com/2008/05/06/covering-the-mummies/">sometimes quite heated</a>) debate and discussion. Many museums and charities now have careful and detailed rules and regulations about what can be shown. As an example, here is the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Policy-and-position-statements/WTX033469.htm">Wellcome Trust's policy</a>, which may sound restrictive but still allowed the Trust to borrow slices of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/mar/27/albert-einstein-brain-samples-display">Einstein's brain</a> from the Mütter Museum and put them on display last year. </p><p>The people whose body parts end up in such museums were often the most vulnerable, the poor, the colonised, the disabled; but because the Mütter museum is laid out in an extremely old-fashioned form like nineteenth century <a href="http://www.historytoday.com/simon-chaplin/john-hunter-and-anatomy-museum">anatomical and teaching displays</a>, to me it felt much less like a freak show than it might have seemed if it was a more trendy, interactive museum. Whether it is 'disturbing' or 'informative' probably depends on the visitor ? the signage is intelligent, and the special exhibitions were thought-provoking ? but it is certainly not above <a href="http://scholarship.shu.edu/theses/212/">criticism</a>. Personally, exhibitions like this tend to remind me how the human body can be both incredibly vulnerable and amazingly resilient at the same time, and that some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrodysplasia_ossificans_progressiva">heart-breaking diseases remain without cure</a>. </p><h2>Making for the Mountains</h2><p>If that's not exciting enough for you, how about climbing to the 'Top of Europe'? The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungfrau">Jungfrau</a> may not be the highest mountain in the Alps, but it is home to the highest construction in Europe, the <a href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sphinx-observatory">precarious looking Sphinx Observatory</a>, which specialises in <a href="http://actualites.epfl.ch/presseinfo-com?id=620">meteorology </a> and <a href="http://astronomy.snjr.net/blog/?p=205">solar spectography</a>. </p><p>The Jungfrau is also the site of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungfraujoch_railway_station">highest railway station in Europe</a>, which is good news for less energetic travellers (like me!) as we can get out onto the glacier and snowy slopes with minimal effort. Crucial equipment testing was done here for the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2013/may/22/close-shaves-technology-everest">British 1953 Everest Expedition</a>; the testing team was still in the Jungfrau region when they received word that the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2013/may/29/everest-anniversary-international-science">Swiss expeditions of 1952</a> had failed, clearing the way for a British attempt the next year.</p><p>There are even more history of science connections on the nearby <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/faulhorn/202532">Faulhorn</a>, where the <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=77984FDC66A8161B3336D646FEA53681.journals?fromPage=online&aid=6010240">hut established in 1823</a> soon evolved into a hotel, attracting metrologists, astronomers and even organic chemists doing <a href="http://deadscientistoftheweek.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/johannes-wislicenus.html">nutritional research</a>. And if, like all <a href="http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Sheldon_Cooper">good science geeks you love trains</a>, it's fairly easy to travel there from the UK <a href="http://www.seat61.com/Switzerland.htm#Interlaken">entirely by rail</a>. </p><h2>A History of Science Travel Guide</h2><p>If neither of those options appeal, you can always browse the <a href="http://www.bshs.org.uk/">British Society for the History of Science's</a> online <a href="http://www.bshs.org.uk/travel-guide">Travel Guide</a>. This is an on-going project, so at the moment it's still a bit geographically limited (submission guidelines are <a href="http://www.bshs.org.uk/travel-guide/style-guide-for-contributors">here</a>), but you can use the <a href="http://www.bshs.org.uk/travel-guide/travel-guide-map">interactive world map</a> to double check your next holiday destination and find out whether you'll be near a <a href="http://www.bshs.org.uk/travel-guide/richard-feynmans-grave-california">famous scientist's grave</a>, the world's <a href="http://www.bshs.org.uk/travel-guide/sweden-solar-system">largest scale model of the solar system</a>, or <a href="http://www.bshs.org.uk/travel-guide/altamira-cave-near-santillana-del-mar-spain">extraordinary cave paintings</a> (but please don't ask me what train you need for <a href="http://www.bshs.org.uk/travel-guide/category/fairyland">Fairyland</a>). </p><p>Alternatively, if this year's holiday has left you a bit strapped for cash, and you're considering a UK staycation, you might still be able to see a <a href="http://www.bshs.org.uk/travel-guide/darwin-and-glen-roy-scotland">geological puzzle that fascinated Charles Darwin</a>, a <a href="http://www.bshs.org.uk/travel-guide/the-leper-chapel-cambridge">leper chapel</a>, or even some <a href="http://www.bshs.org.uk/travel-guide/crystal-palace-dinosaurs-london-england">dinosaurs</a>.</p><p>Happy Holidays!</p><p><em>Vanessa is already planning next year's break, so tweet your suggestions to <a href="https://twitter.com/HPS_Vanessa">@HPS_Vanessa</a></em></p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/history-science">History of science</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/vanessa-heggie">Vanessa Heggie</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
