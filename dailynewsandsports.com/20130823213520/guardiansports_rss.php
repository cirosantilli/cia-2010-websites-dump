Borussia Dortmund 1-0 Werder Bremen<br /></p><p>Robert Lewandowski's second-half goal took Borussia Dortmund clear at the top of the Bundesliga thanks to a 1-0 win over Werder Bremen in a one-sided match at the Westfalenstadion.</p><p>Lewandowski netted the only goal of the game in the 55th minute, but Dortmund should have won more convincingly as they created enough chances to win by a rugby score.</p><p>Bremen lost their unbeaten start to the season, but apart from a Marko Arnautovic effort before half-time and a Franco Di Santo shot, they spent much of the game defending their own goal. The chances came thick and fast for the home side with Marco Reus terrorising the Bremen defence. A combination of the visitors' goalkeeper Sebastian Mielitz and some wasteful finishing ensured the visitors were still in the game after half an hour.</p><p>The crossbar came to Bremen's rescue as Jakub Blaszczykowski's shot cannoned out. Lewandowski then went close several times before Arnautovic almost silenced the home fans on the stroke of half-time, his shot brushing the far post on its way wide.</p><p>It was a similar story in the second half with Dortmund dominating, and they finally scored 10 minutes in. Reus squared the ball from the right to the unmarked Lewandowski who had an easy tap-in.</p><p>Di Santo came on for his Bremen debut and he almost marked it with a goal, testing Roman Weidenfeller's alertness four minutes from time. An equaliser would have been cruel on Dortmund, but their failure to add a second meant they had to suffer for their third win in a row.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/werderbremen">Werder Bremen</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball">Bundesliga</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/europeanfootball">European club football</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Root says England's dismal run rate was not planned<br />? Michael Clarke hits out at Kevin Pietersen in the middle<br />? <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/23/kevin-pietersen-england-australia-oval-test" title="">Read Mike Selvey's day three match report</a></p><p>Joe Root defended <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/23/kevin-pietersen-england-australia-oval-test" title="">England's Kennington crawl</a> after Australia's mockery of their safety-first approach had led to the most prolonged and visible on-field exchanges of the Ashes series between Kevin Pietersen and Michael Clarke.</p><p>The umpire Aleem Dar had to intervene on two separate occasions to remind the former Hampshire team-mates of their responsibilities <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/23/england-australia-kevin-pietersen-michael-clarke" title="">as they traded words from long distance</a>, Pietersen at the non-striker's end and Clarke at second slip, after Jonathan Trott had fallen to the second new ball shortly before tea.</p><p>Geoff Boycott on the BBC's Test Match Special, having heard the exchanges through the stump microphone during a commentary stint for Channel Five, said that the pair were mocking each other for their lack of popularity with their team-mates. There was a little more chirp as the players left the field for tea after another over from Ryan Harris but all seemed quiet when Pietersen and Bell resumed after the interval.</p><p>"I think it was just asking them what they were up to and if they were thinking of playing a few strokes or trying to push the runs along," Peter Siddle later revealed.</p><p>But Root, while conceding that it had not been a sparkling day's cricket, insisted that England were a victim of circumstances, and that they had not begun their innings with the sole intention of hanging on for a draw. "People come to watch cricket for a number of reasons but that's something we can't always control," he said. "Obviously there's some sort of responsibility otherwise no one would come and watch. But it can't happen every game.</p><p>"We need to play the situation. Fair credit to Australia, they made it very hard for us to score fluently. The pitch is quite slow and quite hard to time the ball on, and you've seen throughout the summer people like Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen who generally score fluently, it's not always that easy. We've played pretty well to get to where we have."</p><p>Nevertheless Root left the impression that England are now resigned to the preservation of their 3-0 series lead being the best outcome and have given up on the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/20/ashes-alastair-cook-the-oval" title="">pre-match hopes of inflicting an historic 4-0 humiliation on the Australians</a>. "You want to win by as big a margin as possible," he said. "If we can go away with 3-0, that's obviously going to stand us in good stead going to Australia [for the return series this winter]. You always want to stay in front of the game if possible, but if not you want to find a way of fighting back into it."</p><p>Siddle paid England a backhanded compliment by stressing Australia's satisfaction at having restricted them by bowling dry, very much following the example set by Andy Flower's team in the last three Ashes series, even though they had taken only four wickets in the day. "Yeah, it is hard," he added. "As a bowling team you want to take wickets but we did bowl well and build a lot of pressure; it's just unfortunate we couldn't get those breakthroughs. They might have played defensively. If they want to play that way they can. We've put ourselves in this position [3-0 down], so we can't control it."</p><p>Pietersen had received warmer words, and applause, during the lunch interval when he was presented with a silver bat by Giles Clarke, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, to recognise his achievement earlier in the series of becoming England's leading run-scorer in all forms of cricket. He passed Graham Gooch's tally of 13,190 during the third Test at Old Trafford and now has a total of 13,370 ? 7,825 in 99 Test appearances, 4,369 in 132 one-day internationals and 1,176 in 37 international T20 fixtures.</p><p>Pietersen had been surprised and genuinely moved when informed of the record following his century at Old Trafford and he tweeted before play began on Friday morning that there would be "an incredibly proud moment in my career happening at the lunch break today". Jimmy Anderson was presented with a silver ball earlier this year after he became England's leading wicket-taker in all forms of the game, having overtaken Ian Botham's tally of 528.</p><p>England have "welcomed the swift action" taken by the International Cricket Council in fining <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/22/australia-darren-lehmann-fined-stuart-braod" title="">Australia's coach, Darren Lehmann, for calling Stuart Broad a cheat</a> and also Lehmann's and Australia's immediate acceptance of the punishment.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashes-2013">Ashes 2013</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/kevin-pietersen">Kevin Pietersen</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/michael-clarke">Michael Clarke</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/england-cricket-team">England cricket team</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-cricket-team">Australia cricket team</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashes">The Ashes</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket">Cricket</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-sport">Australia sport</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/andywilson">Andy Wilson</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Little-known Australian expected to replace Mark Webber<br />? Kimi Raikkonen overtaken in race to join Sebastian Vettel<br /></p><p>On the catwalk that doubles as a Formula One paddock, Daniel Ricciardo has been turning heads like no one else at Spa-Francorchamps this week. Reporters have trailed the Australian like bunting wherever he goes and photographers, some of whom had&nbsp;only recently learned what he looked like, have been restricted to taking long shots through the windows of the Toro Rosso motorhome.</p><p>Daniel is travelling tonight on a plane, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=elton+john+daniel+official+music+video&oq=elton+john+daniel&gs_l=youtube.1.2.0l10.256.3537.0.5626.17.9.0.5.5.2.976.3872.1j3j4-1j1j3.9.0...0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.JJNrDImRUDU" title="">sang Elton John</a>, but at one of Formula One's most attractive circuits he has actually arrived, it seems. All smooth driving and easy smiles, he emerged this week as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/19/red-bull-daniel-ricciardo" title="">the favourite to fill the most coveted seat in F1</a>, beside Sebastian Vettel in the fastest car in the business, Red Bull, as Mark Webber prepares to leave the sport at the end of the season.</p><p>The former world champions Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen, who were once linked with the job, were left at the back of the grid by the comparatively anonymous young man from Perth, who stands a modest 14th in the world championship table and whose best position was seventh in China in April.</p><p>In dynasty terms, Ricciardo is the man for Red Bull, the prince of the kingdom, having emerged ahead of his team-mate Jean-Eric Vergne at Toro Rosso, Red Bull's feeder team, who fight for mid-table points. F1, of course, is not&nbsp;a dynasty and for most people Raikkonen remains the obvious choice, despite remarks from the driver's manager, Steve Robertson, that talks have broken down.</p><p>Maybe Robertson and Raikkonen are just raising the stakes. Red Bull's race team are certainly attracted to a proven race winner, such as Raikkonen, but at the same time Red Bull are anxious to promote their driver development programme.</p><p>This is the influential adviser Helmut Marko's baby. So far, it has produced only Vettel but he is something of a one-off. Besides, if Toro Rosso was Vettel's junior school, BMW could claim to have been the German's finishing school, so the youth project cannot claim too much credit. So if it is not Raikkonen, it is most likely to be Ricciardo, and he appears to be psychologically prepared.</p><p>"I haven't signed anything yet," he grinned on Friday. "People are getting excited but I can assure you that nothing's done and I still need to push and prove I'm ready for the seat. If I get the seat, Sebastian is one of the best, so there would be a lot to live up to. But I would put pressure on myself to deliver and get the results. I would be ready for the challenge."</p><p>Despite his easy-going personality there is no shortage of self-confidence. "If I was to get the opportunity I would start my real quest, to be world champion," he says. "I'd start with some podiums, then a few wins and then, hopefully, the big title. This is why I race Formula One, to be successful, and I hope this will be part of my journey there."</p><p>The chance to succeed Webber also appeals. "Ayrton Senna, at the end of his career, was my first hero, when I was very young, and then as I started to grow up it became Webber. Coming from Australia he gave me the hope that it could be done. I followed him for quite a while, even before he was in Formula One. I've used him as a bit of role model.</p><p>"We speak. He gives me advice. I try not to interfere too much. I know he's still got a lot on his plate but it's nice to get feedback from someone who's done the hard yards, who's been there and won races."</p><p>After the years of Scott Speed, Vitantonio Liuzzi, Sébastien Bourdais, Sébastien Buemi and Jaime Alguersuari, Ricciardo and Vergne represent Toro Rosso's most creditable pairing and it has been Ricciardo who has caught the eye with the more impressive qualifying performances. Red&nbsp;Bull's team principal, Christian Horner, was complimentary, without being quite effusive, when he said: "Daniel's obviously developing very well. He's done a good job this year for Toro Rosso. His test for us, the tyre test at Silverstone, was all he could have done. We're pleased by how he has developed."</p><p>But Horner also refused to rule out Raikkonen. The worry for Red Bull would be that they would not have any control over the maverick Finn. Nor does Raikkonen's alleged friendship with Vettel count for much. "In F1 parlance that just means they don't hate each other's guts," said a Red Bull insider. "Seb would hate it if Kimi was suddenly quicker than him."</p><p>Vettel said on Friday: "The situation is the same as four weeks ago. Nothing has changed, apart from more rumours and more teams." Horner says Vettel does not have the power to veto a new driver but Marko is a key figure at Milton Keynes and he has Vettel's interests at heart. And that's&nbsp;another boost for Ricciardo's considerable chances.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/red-bull">Red Bull</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/toro-rosso">Toro Rosso</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/kimi-raikkonen">Kimi Raikkonen</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formula-one-2013">Formula One 2013</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone">Formula One</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/motorsports">Motor sport</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paulweaver">Paul Weaver</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Welsh FA have made me feel welcome and they've done that countless times with other players, Jens Lehmann [the former Arsenal and Germany goalkeeper] has been on the course, so has Marcel Desailly [the former France and Chelsea defender]. What I like about it is it's professional and they're quite flexible in how they&nbsp;teach. And it's something different. I&nbsp;wanted to change.</p><p>I wanted to be with different people with different ideas. I have been with the English FA since I was 14 years old but they've not&nbsp;really made me feel welcome. I've tried numerous times to do something with them. At the moment I go into Arsenal two days a week to coach. I work with the youth team and the reserves but it's whatever I can get, really. It's just getting the hours to practise, seeing how I like to do things. When I see the pitch I come alive, it just clicks. I know&nbsp;in my head how I want the training sessions to go and what I want out of the players.</p><p>I think in the future, I&nbsp;would like to manage and coach, but you need a team around you. I'm a great believer in having a coach for each department of the team.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Garry Monk, 34</strong></h2><p><strong>Swansea City defender, who is now coaching part-time at the club's&nbsp;academy </strong>Coaching is something I've always thought about. I've seen the British way of playing, the foreign influence and a more technical way of playing, the way players have adapted and how it's grown. And I think with that sort of experience it's nice to try and give something back or implement it, hopefully at Swansea if I can do it in that capacity, or if it means going further afield, so be it. Courses like this&nbsp;are vitally important.</p><p>You can have&nbsp;all the knowledge but the way you structure a session ? the preparation and thinking behind it all ? is something you never consider as a player. And it makes you realise that there's got to be a reason why you're putting a session on. The way I look at it, Spanish kids aren't born with that technical ability, they're coached that way, there is a process. We've got the players. I look at someone like Leon Britton [his Swansea City team-mate] at our place, he could have spent his whole career in League Two and you wouldn't have batted an eyelid. But given the opportunity, and the right coaching, he's now one of the best passers in the Premier League.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Neil Smothers, 35</strong></h2><p><strong>The assistant manager at Carmarthen Town in the Welsh Premier League, and a PE teacher </strong>As part of my job I&nbsp;have my B licence, so I thought it was a natural progression to come on to the A licence, which has been really enjoyable. I know the basics, but the football specifics, the tactics, I learn massively from every session that we do. I don't work with a professional club so I can't get my hands on 22 players instantly if I need them for a session ? I can't pull players in from the youth team or reserves. But I think the good thing about the course, which Osian Roberts has drilled into us, is that the same principles apply.</p><p>Before people might have thought: 'I've only got nine players, I can't really do anything with that number, I'll just give them a game.' Now, I think: 'I've got nine, what can I do with them which is useful.' The point is, regardless of who you are, how many players you've got and what level they're at, you as a coach have got to take responsibility to plan sessions which are useful and enjoyable. That's one part of the course which has made me reflect and think a lot more about what I do.</p><p></p><h2>Matthew Bloxham, 26 </h2><p><strong>Player development manager at Cardiff City</strong> I think I quickly realised I wasn't going to become a top player, and as soon as I realised that I started to go towards coaching. I started coaching 12 years ago, I've worked my way up with Cardiff from the community scheme all the way through to part-time academy coach, then I was full-time with the 12-16s and now I'm player development manager for the academy.</p><p>It's a great learning experience working with youngsters. I think if you can teach a young person with no idea of tactical concepts or technical principles how to do something, it's a good grounding for whatever you go on to do in the future. This course has been brilliant. There are great discussions within the group and all the content is modern and relevant. It's great to have such open staff and fellow delegates who have real world experience. I think we're all learning together. Some have got different playing backgrounds and played at an elite level. Patrick has obviously won a World Cup; I can't compete with that, but I've got experience in coaching, so I'm a little bit more comfortable in some areas where they're still learning.</p><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/stuartjames">Stuart James</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

'If he stays, we are going to work on him,' says manager <br />? Di Canio's belief in his 'revolution' unshaken by Fulham loss</p><p>Paolo Di Canio will offer Lee Cattermole a fresh chance and has pledged to "work on" the midfielder should Sunderland's former captain find himself still at the Stadium of Light when the transfer window closes.</p><p>Captain, key enforcer and often much-indulged favourite under the former managers Steve Bruce and Martin O'Neill, Cattermole does not enjoy a similarly privileged status these days. He was sidelined with knee trouble when Di Canio became Sunderland's manager and has subsequently picked up a milder injury. The player's well-documented poor disciplinary record and friendships with members of the dressing room's old guard, resistant to the Italian's "revolution", have also placed a question mark against the midfielder's future.</p><p>In an ideal world Di Canio would probably rather replace Cattermole but his high wages and history of knee trouble may mean a player who, when fit and not suspended, can be highly effective, ends up staying put.</p><p>"There was a chance Cattermole would move somewhere," said Di Canio. "It didn't happen, for different reasons, we can't say why, it's between the club and the player.</p><p>"Now he's working. He had a problem last week in the under-21s and now he's in recovery. At the beginning he wasn't fit and he hasn't trained with us yet but now we are waiting to see what is going on. If at the end of the window, he's gone, he's gone. If he stays, we are going to work on him."</p><p>While Cattermole's enduring presence in the dressing room could represent a potential challenge to Di Canio's strict new regime, it would be intriguing to see how radically the Italian's coaching may improve a player once coveted by Liverpool, and whether he could win the battle for Cattermole's heart and mind.</p><p>Adamant the club is run on meritocratic lines, Di Canio has denied being responsible for changing Cattermole's squad number from six to 33.</p><p>"The squad numbers are decided by the players," he said. "They have a meeting to decide, have six, have 10, have nine, I don't go in. It belongs to them. As I have always said I don't invade their area which is the dressing room. It is their kingdom.</p><p>"I was a footballer, I know what it means. I can have a joke from the corridor but not go inside because this is their private way. It's exactly the same with the numbers. Sometimes they have a 50-50 with a number and they put money for charity, this is the way, but this is not my decision."</p><p>Sunderland's manager refrained from commenting on <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/20/sunderland-suspend-phil-bardsley" title="">Phil Bardsley's indefinite suspension from the club</a> as an investigation into comments the defender apparently posted on social media mocking the team's <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/18/sunderland-fulham-premier-league" title="">1-0 home defeat to Fulham</a> last week is ongoing.</p><p>Encouraged by the performance, if not the result, against Martin Jol's side, Di Canio is hoping for an improvement at Southampton on Saturday.</p><p>"When I change 11 players and have a revolution ? changing how to behave, play football, change the system ? even if we lose another two games we have to believe in what we do," he said.</p><p>"I really believe that this is the way to get better results, and to play the type of football that the players and the fans can enjoy. It happened to me at Swindon, even if the circumstances are different. After five games, four defeats, I think maybe I'm going to be sacked, or maybe not. We weren't. Then, at the end of the season, we won the league.</p><p>"Obviously, I can't promise that here, but there is a revolution and you can't give up. Even if we lose badly on Saturday ? we're going to probably win ? you can't give up after one, two, three, four, five games because you don't believe what you're doing.</p><p>"We've prepared this for 40 days, for me two years, three years, five years, because I believe in this way. We lost one game after dominating. I believe in it even more.</p><p>"We have to work to complete what we saw against Fulham. It can be something special. Because if we can play this football, not every game, but many times this season, we're going to be happy many times."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland">Sunderland</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/paolo-di-canio">Paolo Di Canio</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/louisetaylor">Louise Taylor</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The hot seat is at the front of the lecture room at Dragon Park, the national football development centre in south Wales, and each person speaks for up to two minutes.</p><p>Sol Campbell says how it has been difficult to coach at Arsenal over the summer because of various pre-season tours; Gary Lloyd explains that the trials and tribulations at Llanelli mean he has been putting on training sessions with only half a dozen players; Michael Flynn reveals how he has driven his Newport County manager around the bend by offering tactical tips from the substitutes' bench; while Patrick Vieira talks about getting to grips with managing Manchester City's under-21 squad during a break in Croatia.</p><p>The stories and anecdotes paint a picture of a remarkably diverse group in which a World Cup winner, former England international and current Premier League player discuss tactics and training methods alongside the Port Talbot Town manager, a player-coach at Aberystwyth and a striker for The New Saints.</p><p>This is the first time that the candidates have got together since they enrolled in June and there will be another four meetings in Newport over the next 10 months as they work towards gaining Uefa's advanced coaching award ? the second-highest qualification after the pro licence ? through the course put on by Roberts and the rest of his team at the Welsh Football Trust.</p><p>Earlier this week the Guardian was given access all areas at Dragon Park across two fascinating days. Uefa have mandatory criteria for what needs to be taught across a minimum amount of time on the A licence but the flexibility outside of that framework has encouraged Roberts to broaden the issues that they cover, increase the number of hours and make huge changes to the way the course is delivered.</p><p>In the past, candidates would attend for nine intensive days at the start and the end of the year with no contact in between and be assessed while coaching either their colleagues on the course or children brought in from outside. Under the new system, they report every couple of months to give them a chance to digest the information, complete theoretical and practical tasks during every eight-week block and are assigned a mentor who observes them coaching at their own clubs.</p><p>"It's harder for us now because it's more of a drain on resources but I thought it was the right thing to do in terms of the learning environment for the candidates," Roberts says. "It was simulation before, and when they got all the information, by the time they got around to doing the work, they'd probably forgotten a lot of it. We thought it's got to be better than that, it needs to be reality-based learning where they do it with their own players."</p><p>The Welsh course costs £3,700 and Roberts had so much interest this year that he held interviews to decide who would be selected. The majority of the candidates are Welsh, or coaches working in Wales, with the ultimate aim being to improve the standard of football in the country, but a handful of places are made available to others who can "enrich the course with their contribution". It says much for the reputation of the course in Newport that, as well as Vieira and Campbell, there is a Dutchman who is working for Porto and a Portuguese coach from Benfica.</p><p>One of the key attractions is that Roberts and his deputy, Carl Darlington, are not in the business of cloning coaches. "That is what I like, because there are 24 people in the room and we may have 24 different visions," Vieira says. "There is not only one way to coach. They teach you to be a coach with your personality and who you are and they try to give you tools for you to put your philosophy on the table."</p><p>Playing philosophy is top of the agenda on day one. Steve Cooper, who worked alongside a couple of former Barcelona staff in the academy manager role he held at Liverpool until the summer, is among the guest speakers and delivers an impressive presentation on the importance of coaches believing in their tactics and being able to produce training sessions to support the way that they want to play.</p><p>Cooper looks at the 4-3-3 formation in detail and talks about building, creating and finishing the attack in that system by constructing lopsided diamonds all over the pitch and establishing "movement patterns" that can be worked on time and again on the training ground.</p><p>If that sounds complicated, the simplicity behind the tactics comes through in the afternoon when Cooper puts on a practical session to underpin the tactical theory. He starts with four players, who are passing and moving in a small diamond no more than 10 yards apart, later introduces two defenders to oppose them and eventually progresses to a larger area and increases the numbers to make it more realistic.</p><p>For Garry Monk, who has long thought about going into coaching after playing, it was like being on the training ground at Swansea. "It's funny, because when Coops was doing that, I was thinking I'm lucky because I've done so much of that at Swansea," Monk says. "That was what Roberto [Martínez] implemented. We'd do drills similar to that. It would be repetition but it wasn't boring. You realised what it was for and that it was important. If you are trying to get your philosophy across, it's a very good way to implement it, in terms of the patterns of play."</p><p>After a short break, Darlington takes over from Cooper and, using the same 4-3-3 formation as a starting point, runs through a "function" ? a training exercise that zooms in on an area of the pitch.</p><p>Darlington wants to create midfield overloads in the centre of the field with a view to ultimately getting one of his three forwards beyond the two centre-backs. The candidates take part and in Vieira and Dan Connor ? a former France international and an erstwhile Hereford goalkeeper ? the attacking players have come up against an unlikely but streetwise midfield pair. Vieira and Connor sit deep, making it hard for the attacking team to get in behind them to penetrate.</p><p>"Patrick and Dan weren't shifting much but that's fine because that's going to happen in a game," Darlington says afterwards. "We have to try and create a different opportunity, and the opportunity I wanted was when the ball comes into the deep-lying midfielder, the first central midfield player comes deep. Hopefully that now drags Patrick or Dan out with him, and I now I want the wide forward to come inside and be the second player in that pocket of space that opens up."</p><p>Back inside, Roberts asks the candidates for the "take-home messages" from Cooper's presentation and training session. Once the flip chart is full of observations, Roberts makes the point that nearly all the suggestions put forward ? the importance of structure, training methodology, detail ? can be applied to any formation, not just 4-3-3. While the work in the lecture room is important, Roberts "firmly believes that coach-educators need to be practitioners, out there working with players and teams, otherwise there's that danger that you become very theoretical".</p><p>Roberts works with elite players in his role as Chris Coleman's coach for the national team and he also takes charge of the Wales Under-16 side. Just as importantly, though, he has the experience of managing a team in the Welsh Premier League, where you work with part-time footballers twice a week.</p><p>"I used to film all my training sessions in the Welsh Prem, and the injured players would do the hand-notation analysis. I'd come in at half-time and ask how many crosses we got in from an area and they'd give me the answer.</p><p>"I'd take my laptop in before the game and show the striker his movement last week. So no one can turn around and say: 'You can't do that in the Welsh Prem.' You do the best you can in that scenario."</p><p>Early in the evening the candidates move on to a hotel in Cardiff where Kevin Russell, Peterborough United's assistant manager, gives a presentation on the role of a No2. There is plenty of interaction from the candidates, in particular from Vieira, who has tasted success at the highest level as a player but seems genuinely interested to find out how the assistant manager of a League One club would, for example, deal with a player who is lazy in training but performs on a Saturday.</p><p>"I'm really open and I want to learn and this is the best place for me to do it," Vieira says. "I've experience on the field that will help me to deal with certain situations but I don't have any experience on the bench ? how to set up a training session, how to deal with the players, and this is why I'm doing the course. I chose a place where I feel comfortable to learn, where there is no egos and where they treat everyone the same."</p><p>Back at Dragon Park the following morning, Roberts starts by talking about "zone 14", an area just in front of the opposition's penalty area where, according to researchers at Liverpool's John Moores University, the majority of assists come from. In an era of false 9s, No10s and wingers that cut inside rather than get to the byline, there is no shortage of footage available to support the theory.</p><p>Roberts divides the candidates into five groups and gives them a tactical challenge on the back of what they have just seen and heard. Campbell's group, for example, are told that their team is playing 4-1-2-3 against 4-2-3-1 and that they must focus on the midfield three exploiting zone 14. They have an hour to come up with different options as well as a way to train players to execute their tactics.</p><p>Campbell played 73 times for England and has a wealth of playing experience to draw upon but the work in the lecture room presents new challenges. "On the field is where I'm king, where I see things and I'm natural at the things I want to do," he says. "I understand the psyche of it ? you want to be able to see pictures in training, so that you can give those pictures to someone who can't see it. The other side I've got to get used to because I've spent most of my life on the grass ? that's been my classroom. I'll be good at the other side but I've got to embrace it more."</p><p>After a short break, Darren Ferguson, the Peterborough manager, who is revalidating his pro licence, takes part in a 45-minute question-and-answer session, during which he gives the candidates invaluable advice across a wide range of issues, including the importance of interviewing the interviewer when going for a job and why it always pays to be honest with players, even if they do not want to hear what you have got to say.</p><p>"That real-life insight is really important," Roberts says.</p><p>The afternoon finishes with each group presenting their solutions to the zone 14 task that they were given. They use a tactics board and break down what they expect from each player as if they were addressing their squad in a team meeting before a match.</p><p>"The days of saying: 'Win your individual battles and you'll be all right' are gone, because you don't play one v one any more," Roberts says.</p><p>"At the same time, we don't complicate it here.

It was hard to say which was the most energetic activity of the three. England's pace was as sedate as that of the heavy grey clouds which drifted over as the day wore away. In the morning they scored 65 runs, in the afternoon another 84 and after tea 66. They ticked along at two an over, a clock without a second hand, turning slowly towards stumps and the end of the series.</p><p>Of course, they have earned the right to play this way. It is a privilege that comes with being 3-0 up. But for anyone other than the most one-eyed supporter, it was stultifying stuff. By the end of the day the crowd were cheering singles and giving standing ovations for the few fours they saw. The slow pace is fine for those in the free seats, giving ample time to fetch a cup of tea between balls. But the spectators have paid at least £75 for their tickets. And the average fan at a Test spends another £79 ? according to a study done by London Economics on behalf of MCC ? on travel and food.</p><p>They were, at least, better off than the thousands who had been here the day before, who spent three hours sheltering from the rain before enduring two sessions in which England's over rate slipped from sluggish to sedentary, reaching a nadir of 11 overs in an hour. Again, the tactic was legitimate but dull. What did not wash was the explanation that the bowling coach, David Saker, served up afterwards, in which he insisted that the slow speed of play had been because it was impossible, unfair even, for the team to work any faster with a wet ball.</p><p>The over rate was too slow for Darren Lehmann. After stumps he mischievously apologised on England's behalf for boring the spectators. "Sorry about the over rate! Will be better tomorrow," he tweeted. Which was refreshing to read. A little more honesty from England would go a long way. As is often the way with this team, there is a disparity between what they say and the way they play. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/19/england-australia-ashes-2013-stuart-broad" title="">"We want to win, we want to make the fans happy," said Stuart Broad before this game. "We need to keep throwing punches and damaging these players."</a> Right now they look as if they are leaning on the opposition in the last round, secure in the knowledge they are ahead on points and the bell is about to ring.</p><p>Alastair Cook's talk of targeting a famous 4-0 win does not square with the way in which England have dawdled with the ball and languished with the bat. In fact, it made him sound as disingenuous as the shopkeeper in Monty Python's dead parrot sketch. Better, surely, to admit what his team are up to. The onus is on Australia to force the game to a result and on the umpires to usher the bowlers along, something neither Aleem Dar nor Kumar Dharmasena seemed inclined to do.</p><p>Some will say that the cricket is soporific because this is a dead match. But it was a similar story at Old Trafford, when they insisted they wanted to win even though it was obvious they had soon decided to settle for a draw. They stalled for time then too, their over rate falling to 12 an hour. They have used the tactic right through the series, going back to the first Test at Trent Bridge, when Broad changing his boot to stretch his over out a little longer before lunch.</p><p>Earlier this week <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/theashes/10255512/The-Ashes-2013-England-3-0-up-against-Australia-says-Matt-Prior-so-why-are-we-given-so-much-stick.html" title="">Matt Prior asked why the team were being criticised by the public when they were winning the series</a>. There were a few thousand people at The Oval who could have given him an idea about the answer. "Tedious, boring and methodical," was how one spectator described them. "I could have stayed at home and put a coat of creosote on my fence," said another. "And I could have paid to watch you," said his pal.</p><p>There will be a few howls of protest at that, indignant fans insisting that England are winning and that should be enough in itself. In that same interview Broad said "we have been accused of all sorts. Those sorts of things are not remembered. It is winning the series that is remembered." Which is not quite right. During the rain break on Thursday Sky filled the empty hours by showing an interview with Brian Lara. And those who watched it might have been reminded of his words immediately after his last international match. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6580385.stm" title="">"All I ask," Lara said to the crowd "is 'Did I entertain you?' If I entertained you, I'm happy."</a> There is something in that, perhaps, for a few of England's players to think about.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashes-2013">Ashes 2013</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/england-cricket-team">England cricket team</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-cricket-team">Australia cricket team</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket">Cricket</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-sport">Australia sport</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashes">The Ashes</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/andybull">Andy Bull</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Yorkshire 407 and 12-0; Notts 150 and 266 <br />? Yorkshire win by 10 wickets</p><p>The County Championship is now Yorkshire's to lose after this comprehensive thrashing of Nottinghamshire left them 33 points clear at the top of the table with four matches to play. Victory over Durham at Scarborough next week would effectively seal the title.</p><p>As their veteran left-arm seamer Ryan Sidebottom pointed out, this was a win that in many respects summed up their season. Every player made an important contribution and that included the 12th man, Richard Pyrah, whose catch on the boundary to dismiss Samit Patel on Thursday evening was among the best this season.</p><p>Sidebottom, who finished with match figures of seven for 73, also passed a particularly personal milestone. His dismissal of Chris Read shortly after lunch was his 597th first-class wicket, one more than his father, the Yorkshire and England seamer Arnie, took.</p><p>As usual, however, the wickets were shared around, with Jack Brooks, Liam Plunkett, Adil Rashid and, in the first innings in particular, Steven Patterson picking up their share. The batsmen more than played their part, because to score more than 400 after being put in on a pitch that seamed throughout was an outstanding effort.</p><p>"You don't win a championship with five or six players, you have to be a real team," Sidebottom said. "We saw the way the ball darted and jagged around when we were batting and we thought with our seamers and the way we've been bowling we could put them under a bit more pressure. We did that, we pitched the ball up a bit more and made them play a little bit more, and it told in the end."</p><p>The director of cricket, Martyn Moxon, also stressed the importance of that first-innings score. "To come here against what, make no mistake, is a strong Notts team and win by 10 wickets in under three days is a great effort.</p><p>"If you take out the first game [<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/13/county-championship-sussex" title="">when Sussex won by an innings at Headingley</a>] we've played good consistent cricket this season. We've had eight different centurions, three bowlers have taken 30 wickets plus and two are in the mid-twenties. Someone has always held their hand up. Adam Lyth's 95 in the first innings here was an example of that."</p><p>Jonny Bairstow set a pretty good example too, recovering from the blow of being discarded by England to score a quick 62 and hold six catches behind the stumps. "He was bitterly disappointed to be left out, as you would expect, but he was buoyant when he arrived and, considering he hasn't kept for a while, did a very good job for us behind the stumps," Moxon said.</p><p>After playing Durham, who have a game in hand, Yorkshire travel to Hove to play Sussex on 11 September, and then play Middlesex at Headingley before their final match against Surrey at The Oval. The odds are that they will sew up the championship on the south coast.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/yorkshire">Yorkshire</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket">Cricket</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/county-championship-2013-division-one">County Championship 2013 Division One</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/countychampionship1stdivisioncricket">County Championship Division One</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ryan-sidebottom">Ryan Sidebottom</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/richardrae">Richard Rae</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Black-and-whites' last trophy was at Cardiff in 2005<br />? Teams stir memories of classic Wembley final in 1985</p><p>The last time <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/aug/28/rugbyleague.hullfcrl" title="">Hull lifted the Challenge Cup, in Cardiff in August 2005</a>, Adam Pearson was in Plymouth watching a 1-0 win for the city's football team who were still some way short of fulfilling their Premier League dreams. Now, as Hull City prepare to celebrate their return to football's top tier with a first home game against Norwich, Pearson is relishing the prospect of leading out, with his two young daughters, the black and whites at Wembley in his role as the owner and chairman of the great underachievers of British rugby league.</p><p>The first cup final meeting of Hull and Wigan since <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/that-1980s-sports-blog/2013/aug/21/challenge-cup-final-1985-wigan-hull" title="">the 1985 classic ? Brett Kenny, Peter Sterling, Henderson Gill and all that</a> ? kicks off at 3pm, the same time as the Premier League fixture at the KC Stadium. Early in the morning of a significant sporting day in the city more than 170 coaches will head west along the A63 for another hopeful pilgrimage down the M1.</p><p>Hull have never won at Wembley in seven final appearances, as they are regularly reminded by supporters of Hull Kingston Rovers who inflicted the most painful of the defeats in 1980. Their three cup wins came at Thrum Hall in 1914, Elland Road in 1982 ? in a replay after a Wembley draw against Widnes ? and Cardiff eight years ago.</p><p>Yet Hull rivals, and probably surpasses, Leeds as the British city where league means the most and, although the resurgence of Rovers to provide a second Super League force in the East Riding for the past seven seasons has diluted FC's financial clout, winning a single trophy&nbsp;? that memorable triumph against Leeds at the Millennium Stadium ? in more than two decades is a damning statistic.</p><p>Having spent a large chunk of his adult life working in the city, Pearson, who is from West Yorkshire, recognised that potential when he bought the club in the summer of 2011. He describes reaching Wembley, in the second full season since he brought <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/12/hull-fc-peter-gentle-coach" title="">Peter Gentle from Australia </a>to lead a complete overhaul of the coaching staff, as "the first step" on a road that will lead, if all goes to plan, to a first Super League Grand Final win &nbsp;at Old Trafford in the next couple &nbsp;of years.</p><p>In many ways the success of Wigan under the ownership of Ian Lenagan over the past four years represents the model Pearson wishes to follow. This will be their second Wembley appearance in three summers, having previously endured a 16-year absence from the venue with which they remain so closely linked after winning the cup for eight straight seasons from 1988 to 1995.</p><p>Like Hull they continue to enjoy substantial support despite the unprecedented success of their footballing landlords, because rugby league is so deeply embedded in the town and its surrounds. "It's the heartbeat of the place, pretty much," said Joel Tomkins, who is now exiled in Hertfordshire and plays rugby union for Saracens.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hDRcOq5rdk" title="">He scored a spectacular long-range try</a>, having been set free by his younger brother Sam <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/aug/28/wigan-leeds-challenge-cup-final" title="">when Wigan beat Leeds two years ago</a>, and admits he will envy Sam and Logan, a third Tomkins who is in line to make his Wembley debut at the age of 22, when he takes his seat alongside a posse of fellow Saracens including Andy and Owen Farrell.</p><p>The Tomkins boys are two of 11 local lads in Wigan's 19-man squad. Hull have six, including Jamie Shaul, a pacy but raw full-back, the loyal veteran Richard Horne, and Ben Crooks, a rangy centre whose father, Lee, played in the 28-24 defeat by Wigan 28 years ago. Pearson is convinced that, in time, they can match Wigan for homegrown talent ? even if the locals in Hull would pronounce homegrown slightly differently.</p><p>Hull are underdogs, not so much because of the club's wretched Wembley record as the fact they are nine points and four positions below Wigan in the Super League table, despite the Warriors' recent wobble. Wigan's consecutive defeats by Huddersfield and Catalan could be seen as a worry, although the suspicion is that their coach, Shaun Wane, has been protecting his key men ? notably Sam Tomkins and Sean O'Loughlin, the tough and skilful captain ? in a very old-fashioned Wembley way.</p><p>They have the potential to blitz Hull in the early stages although, if the forecasters are correct, this could be a rare wet-weather Wembley, if not quite a repeat of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqXTrw1VFBE" title="">the Watersplash final of 1968</a>. It would be greedy and unrealistic to expect <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b3IbRSI1io" title="">anything quite as good as 1985</a> but the game is set up intriguingly nonetheless.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/challengecup">Challenge Cup</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rugbyleague">Rugby league</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/hull-fc">Hull FC</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/wiganwarriors">Wigan Warriors</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/andywilson">Andy Wilson</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It was odd: they had paid their money and yet, in the cause, they were willing an abandonment. The Guardian even got a title for a book out of it: Is it Cowardly to Pray for Rain? Weather interference would have been a blessed relief on the third day of a match that England, unilaterally, are turning into one of the more tedious in recent memory.</p><p>This is a team who have won a series already making damn sure that the opposition do not get a sniff of a late win to take home and sustain them, and in the process making a mockery of poor David Saker, England's fast bowling coach, forced the previous evening to utter some guff about the team still believing they could win the match. It was a team who were doing what they felt they had to do but even the connoisseurs, to whom such days are usually ascribed as being interesting, would have thrown the towel in and for stimulation gone to watch tin cans rust instead. It is a rum old day when the highlights appear to have been Kevin Pietersen and Michael Clarke yah-booing each other with an exchange that would do little to disturb the reputations of Oscar Wilde and Dorothy Parker, and the construction of a plastic beer snake.</p><p>By late afternoon, as the sky began to fill in optimistically pewter in colour, each run was being cheered. Boundary futures were soaring on the Stock Exchange as shrewd investors piled in before it closed for the holiday. When Pietersen hit the first boundary in 14 overs, his fourth, to reach his slowest ever Ashes half-century, from 124 balls, there was close to uproar: novelty has its value. When, on Pietersen's demise to Mitchell Starc shortly afterwards, Chris Woakes then drove his first ball in Test cricket handsomely to the square cover boundary, it might have been a World Cup winner at Wembley or VE Day with hats thrown in the air.</p><p>These were the crumbs of comfort on which a sell-out crowd were fed.</p><p>England had begun the third day on 32 without loss and hopes of batting through the day, something they certainly achieved, losing only four wickets in the process. By lunch they had added 65 more runs to that, for the loss of Alastair Cook for 25, who yet again started but was unable to finish. By tea, 38 overs later because of extended hours on account of the bad weather the previous day, the total had swelled by a further 84, to 181 for three. Joe Root had gone for 68, a competent enough innings ? if lent a tame ending as he top-edged a sweep to short fine-leg ? that occupied 184 balls and almost four hours. So, too, had Jonathan Trott, after a flirtation with batting frivolity during the series, restored to his old self as Australia cut off his onside blood supply; he was lbw for a 134-ball 40 to Starc's first delivery with the second new ball.</p><p>Goodness only knows what Woakes was doing livening up proceedings with a couple more handsome boundaries: team-mates will not enjoy being shown up and the new boy clearly has to learn the ropes. It was unacceptable behaviour. Sixty-six more runs eventuated from the final 32 overs and England ended the day on 247 for four, with Ian Bell, it almost goes without saying in this series, unbeaten on 29 (110 balls), and Woakes 15 not out.</p><p>Just in case anyone has lost sight of the fact in all the excitement, England, having scored 215 runs from 98.3 overs in the day, still need a further 46 runs to avoid the possibility (probability even given the weekend weather forecast) of following on. If they do that, then the match could be all but moribund.</p><p>From the moment Clarke won the toss and chose to bat, Australia have had the upper hand in this match. This is not a good Test pitch, in that once the new ball goes softer it offers precious little to the pacemen, even those who really bend their backs, but neither does it help strokemakers beyond putting away half-volleys or long hops. Certainly felicitous touches, even from Bell, who has exhibited more than his fair share in this series, have been out of the question.</p><p>Instead Australia hoisted England with their own petard, sending down arid overs with the seamers and then looking to Nathan Lyon to get some purchase. Just for a while, as Pietersen prodded and poked uncertainly, he found not just some turn from round the wicket (his habitual angle of attack now) but bounce as well. At least it lent some credence to England's decision to play a second spinner, even if he did go into meltdown, and Graeme Swann may yet collect some further Ashes scalps before the match is done. Twice&nbsp;Lyon found the inside edge of Pietersen's bat as he pushed forward firmly, and twice the ball flew from his front pad at pace past the shoulder of short-leg crouched in close.</p><p>Clarke eventually compensated by pushing the fielder back several paces but it was a rare case of the captain bolting the stable door: Pietersen did not give that chance again.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashes-2013">Ashes 2013</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/england-cricket-team">England cricket team</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-cricket-team">Australia cricket team</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket">Cricket</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashes">The Ashes</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-sport">Australia sport</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/mikeselvey">Mike Selvey</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Jockey's career almost wrecked by freak illness<br />? 40-1 winner expected to run in Abbaye and retire</p><p>A jockey fighting his way back from the lowest point of his career was first across the line in the Nunthorpe Stakes here on Friday but he was not the one that most in the packed grandstand expected to see. Frankie Dettori, on the favourite in a British Group One race for the first time since a six-month ban for using cocaine, finished fast but only into second place on Shea Shea, as Steve Drowne, on the 40-1 chance Jwala, held on to win by half a length.</p><p>This was the sixth Group One success of Drowne's career, which is half a dozen more than most jockeys can hope to record, but also the first of what is effectively his second career, following a year on the sidelines in 2012. It was a season when most of his regular employers moved on to new riders and the greatest frustration for Drowne was that for much of the time he was not fighting his way back to fitness but instead trying to slash his way through a jungle of red tape.</p><p>Drowne passed out in his garden in March 2012, and was initially diagnosed as having suffered a seizure. A later diagnosis ? that a viral infection had interrupted the blood supply to his brain ? followed a few weeks later but by then the DVLA had removed his driver's licence. Without a licence to drive, a jockey cannot be insured to ride and it took many months of effort, and the intervention of his local MP, before the DVLA relented.</p><p>"I spent five months getting a second opinion to be proved right," the 41-year-old Drowne said after his victory, "and then another five months arguing with the DVLA. It was so frustrating, because what I had would have kept me out for a fortnight, that's all, but because [of the initial, different diagnosis] it just took so many tests to overturn it.</p><p>"When I put my report into the DVLA, it took them five months just to look at it. If you miss a month, you miss maybe 30% of your horses when they run but, if you miss a year, you miss 100% of them. If any good people win on them, they'll keep the ride, so you're left with the ones that can't win. I've basically had to start again."</p><p>This success, the third in a row by a filly or mare in York's showpiece sprint race, was a surprise to the punters and, on the face of it, a huge swing in form from the King George Stakes at Glorious Goodwood, when Jwala finished a distant last behind Moviesta, one of the favourites for the Nunthope but last of the 17 runners to cross the line.</p><p>That run came after Jwala banged her head on the starting stalls, however, and previous form, including a victory over track and trip at Listed level in July, gave her at least some hope in an open race.</p><p>"She went down in the gate, lifted her head up and fractured an eye-socket and just ran punch-drunk," Cowell, who had three runners in the race, said afterwards. "She's all fine now but it's a big effort after what happened last time.</p><p>"It wasn't really a surprise. I was saying yesterday that I thought she had the best chance of the lot, because she's just uncomplicated, she's got a huge turn of foot and a really high cruising speed and those are the ingredients you need for a really good sprinter."</p><p>The Prix de l'Abbaye at Longchamp on 6 October, a race that Drowne has won twice already, is likely to be the final start of Jwala's racing career before she retires to stud.</p><p>"She's so tough, she had a horrid time at Goodwood and to bounce back and run a race like she just has is amazing," Drowne said. "You can't split Group One races. I've won a July Cup and a couple of Abbayes and they are always memorable but I guess, because of the situation this year and because my back's up against the wall a little bit, this would have to rate right up there."</p><p>Godolphin's royal blue silks dominated the remainder of the card, with two winners for Saeed bin Suroor and one for Charlie Appleby, who replaced his disgraced former boss Mahmood al-Zarooni at Moulton Paddocks in Newmarket a few weeks ago.</p><p>Ahzeemah, who took the Group Two Lonsdale Stakes for Suroor, is a possible runner in the Melbourne Cup in November, while the seven-year-old gelding City Style, a Group Three winner for Appleby in the Strensall Stakes, could go to the Prix Dollar at Longchamp on Arc weekend.</p><p>"The team is in good form," Simon Crisford, Godolphin's racing manager, said. "We're taking singles and doubles but not too many sixes at the moment. We're just hitting the ball well."</p><p>Crisford reported that Libertarian, who joined Godolphin after finishing runner-up to Ruler Of The World in the Derby at Epsom in June, remains a possible runner in the St Leger at Doncaster following a disappointing run in the Irish Derby last time out.</p><p>"Libertarian is back in training now," Crisford said. "If he makes the St Leger, that's great, but we're not going to push him to get him there. We're hopeful that he'll make it, but he's a young horse and he's got it all ahead of him."</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/horse-racing">Horse racing</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/york">York racecourse</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/gregwood">Greg Wood</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It was not a thrilling exhibition of batsmanship since they had been together for almost 32 overs when Cook edged Ryan Harris to the keeper with the score on 68. Up until then this pair had been averaging 23 per partnership. Oh my Hobbs and my Sutcliffe long ago. Well, not just yet.</p><p>It is all a bit odd. By common consent over the decades, a solid opening pair is essential for a successful side. Yet England lead by 3-0 against Australia despite their hesitant starts. Moreover there has been some mumbling about the dryness of the pitches in this series, which one would expect to lead to the neutering of the Australia pace attack.</p><p>Well, as far as Cook and Root are concerned that does not seem to have <sup></sup>happened either.</p><p>England's opening pair has been spluttering like an old banger that is reluctant to start on a freezing February morning, yet there is no real suggestion from any serious pundit that the team have the wrong men at the top.</p><p>Cook is the captain, unassailable and quite rightly so. He has opened the batting in 90 of his 97 Tests. He has scored more&nbsp;Test hundreds than any other Englishman. He may have had a very modest series by his standards ? 243 runs at 27 ? but there can be no doubt that he will be taking guard before any other Englishman in Brisbane in three months'&nbsp;time.</p><p>Up the other end will be Root. Statistically he has had a satisfactory baptism at the top of the order ? 328 runs at 41 is not so bad. It is true that 248 of those runs were scored in two innings ? the 180 at Lord's and his diligent 68 here at The Oval ? but that is part of the deal.</p><p>Opening batsmen are more likely to receive the deadly delivery than anyone else. The ball is hard and bouncy; it might swing; the seam is proud. Even so Root has failed a little too often for comfort.</p><p>Yet he looks the part and the opener's role is one he has fulfilled for the bulk of his first-class career; in fact he looks just like Mike Atherton, a stalwart in a leaner era for English cricket. He rejects a run like Atherton by holding his bat high in a negative manner to augment his delicate vocal chords; he runs like him with a bit of a self-effacing shuffle (hopefully in his case not because of a dodgy back).</p><p>Moreover his technique is not so different either. He likes to stay on the back foot whenever possible, which means that sometimes he is slow in coming forward; he likes to play late; and he is prepared to bat time. Root is also a fine defensive player of spin ? even though Nathan Lyon dismissed him on Friday. Indeed this is what propelled him into the England side in Nagpur, which was the last place the England selectors surprised us before this Test.</p><p>Root was unexpectedly tossed into the team for the final, critical match of the series because he had played a selection of Indian spin bowlers in the nets as well as anyone. There he displayed another Athertonian quality: a wonderful calmness at the crease, which suggested that Test cricket was his natural habitat. He gathered a patient 73. Thereafter the only debate has been where to bat him in the England side.</p><p>The inclination is to keep him at the top with Cook, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/08/ashes-2013-england-root-cook" title="">the hope is that they might be together for half a decade or more and a source of great reassurance</a>. But they have yet to gel as an opening pair. Root may have demonstrated his ability to improvise and to attack against the white ball, but his approach to batting in a Test match is all too similar to Cook's.</p><p>The goal is to wear the opposition bowlers down. It is not this pair's intention to seize the initiative. This coupling of like minds and styles can work; it often did with Andrew Strauss and Cook. But generally opposites gel better: Geoff Boycott and Bob Barber, Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden.</p><p>The pairing of Cook and Root, while it may come to presage hours of toil, is unlikely to induce fear into opposition bowlers. At least they have the confidence of knowing that good deliveries will be respected. As a result they are more likely to propel good deliveries. Simon Kerrigan would have preferred to start his Test career against Cook and Root rather than Shane Watson.</p><p>However the investment in Root has only just started and it won't be deserted. The union with Cook is currently a tentative one but the dividends are likely to compound before long.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/england-cricket-team">England cricket team</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/joe-root">Joe Root</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/alastair-cook">Alastair Cook</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-cricket-team">Australia cricket team</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashes-2013">Ashes 2013</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket">Cricket</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashes">The Ashes</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-sport">Australia sport</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/vicmarks">Vic Marks</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Mercedes driver targets Alonso, Raikkonen and Vettel<br />? But Hamilton struggles in practice for Belgian GP</p><p>Lewis Hamilton says he will hunt down, one by one, the three men who stand before him in the race for the Formula One world championship.</p><p>Hamilton, who is 48 points behind the championship leader Sebastian Vettel going into Sunday's Belgian Grand Prix, said: "The way I look at it, I am not second, I am fourth. So I have got to leapfrog Fernando [Alonso] and then Kimi [Raikkonen] ? two other guys who have been massively consistent, particularly Kimi.</p><p>"It's going to be hard to continually stay ahead of these guys, considering Kimi has finished every race for God knows how long. But I am hunting them down. I am hunting Fernando at the moment, trying to close the gap [nine points] and overtake him and then I will move on to Kimi [10&nbsp;points]."</p><p>The Mercedes driver, who won the last race in Hungary four weeks ago, added: "There is just a generally grateful feeling for the results we are getting because they have not had that before.</p><p>"We need to constantly be gaining on [Vettel] which is not going to be easy because they are massively competitive. But [Red Bull] have not been the strongest at this track for a while so I hope that remains the same and it gives us the chance to close up a little bit. We definitely need to continue with the positive results that we have had in the last few races."</p><p>Hamilton was speaking before Friday's practice sessions, which put a dent in his immediate hopes. Hamilton finished 12th and 15th in the two runs and said afterwards: "It's not been a particularly tough day, just not a good day.</p><p>"I'm struggling ? the car doesn't feel as good as it did in the last race ? but I'm still hopeful. I don't think the car is bad, I just think we need to refine the set-up. The Red Bulls are obviously very quick, but I don't think they're unbeatable.</p><p>"I don't feel we started on the right foot. We have some things to change this evening, but we still have time. The car is really not on the pace, but hopefully this evening we'll change it. At the moment we're a long way off, but we'll find it tonight."</p><p>Vettel and Mark Webber made it a one-two for Red Bull in Friday's second session. But a right-rear puncture spoiled Vettel's afternoon. Fernando Alonso had been fastest in the damp morning run.</p><p>Meanwhile, drivers have asked for assurances about tyre safety at Spa following blow-outs suffered by Vettel and Alonso. F1 race director Charlie Whiting has been asked to seek a guarantee from tyre makers Pirelli that there is no structural issue with the tyres. Pirelli have already reverted to their 2012 tyre following a series of punctures at Silverstone in June. "It is a worry for the sport because we have to go out and find what it is," said Pirelli motorsport director Paul Hembery.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formula-one-2013">Formula One 2013</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone">Formula One</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/mercedes-gp">Mercedes GP</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/motorsports">Motor sport</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paulweaver">Paul Weaver</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Pair warned after swapping views on dressing-room popularity <br />? Pietersen reached 50 before falling to Mitchell Starc</p><p>Michael Clarke and Kevin Pietersen engaged in the most prolonged and visible on-field exchanges of the Ashes series as a soporific afternoon session sprung to life shortly before tea.</p><p>After Jonathan Trott had failed to overturn an excellent decision by the umpire Aleem Dar to fall lbw immediately after Mitchell Starc took the second new ball, Pietersen seemed to take exception to something said from behind the stumps ? where Clarke was fielding at second slip ? to the new batsman, Ian Bell.</p><p>Both Pietersen and Clarke, who were briefly team-mates in county cricket with Hampshire, seemed as amused as they were irritated. But Dar had to intervene on two separate occasions and remind them of their responsibilities as the pleasantries continued for the rest of Starc's over, and again when it ended and Clarke ran past Pietersen and Bell as they chatted in mid-pitch.</p><p>Geoff Boycott on the BBC's Test Match Special, having heard the exchanges through the stump microphone during a commentary stint for Channel Five, said that the pair were mocking each other for their lack of popularity with their team-mates. There was a little more chirp as the players left the field for tea after another over from Ryan Harris, but all seemed quiet when Pietersen and Bell resumed after the interval.</p><p>It was tempting to see the episode as symptomatic of a reversion to old-fashioned Australian aggression from Clarke, with his team on the front foot for the second time in three Tests, and perhaps a precursor to a feistier approach in the return series this winter. However, there was no evidence that Pietersen was rattled as he grafted on through the evening gloom to his slowest Ashes half-century before falling to Starc late in the day.</p><p>Pietersen had received warmer words, and applause, during the lunch interval when he was presented with a silver bat by Giles Clarke, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, to recognise his achievement earlier in the series of becoming England's leading run-scorer in all forms of cricket.</p><p>He passed Graham Gooch's tally of 13,190 during the third Test at Old Trafford and now has 13,370 ? 7,825 in 99 Test appearances, 4,369 in 132 one-day internationals and 1,176 in 37 international T20 fixtures.</p><p>Pietersen had been surprised and genuinely moved when informed of the record following his century at Old Trafford and he tweeted before play began on Friday morning that there would be "an incredibly proud moment in my career happening at the lunch break today".James Anderson was presented with a silver ball earlier this year after he became England's leading wicket-taker in all forms of the game, having overtaken Ian Botham's tally of 528.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashes-2013">Ashes 2013</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/kevin-pietersen">Kevin Pietersen</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/michael-clarke">Michael Clarke</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/andywilson">Andy Wilson</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

England Women 256-6; Australia 205<br />? England win by 51 runs; Ashes series level at 4 points all</p><p><strong> </strong>England struck back in the women's Ashes series with an emphatic 51-run win over Australia at Hove. It was a spirited response to the home side's calamitous batting collapse at Lord's on Tuesday, and leaves the multi-format series all square with four matches remaining.</p><p>Charlotte Edwards led the way with 53 runs off 84 deliveries but the captain was ably supported, with all five top-order batters making healthy contributions to England's total of 256.</p><p>While Australia's fast bowlers struggled for accuracy on the batter-friendly pitch, England's attack tore through the Australian top-order, with only Jess Cameron (81 off 108 balls) offering genuine resistance.</p><p>The win leaves both sides on four points, after one drawn Test and a win apiece in two of the three one-day internationals.</p><p>After England won the toss and elected to bat, their openers Edwards and Heather Knight piled on 45 runs before Knight slapped a wider delivery from Megan Schutt straight to gully in the seventh over.</p><p>Sarah Taylor displayed her customary range of elegant shots in a 60-run partnership with Edwards. But the introduction of Jess Jonassen bore fruit, the left-arm spinner finding the stumps of Taylor (32) in the second over of her first spell, before bowling Edwards (53) around the legs to leave the hosts at 130 for 3.</p><p>At Lord's the loss of England's captain triggered an alarming collapse but in Hove the middle order was made of sterner stuff. Lydia Greenway and Arran Brindle both fell just short of half centuries to Sarah Coyte, but the all-rounder Natalie Sciver chimed in with a rapid-fire 26 off 20 balls to set Australia a target of 257 for victory.</p><p>"We back ourselves and we bat really deep," said the player of the match Anya Shrubsole. "We didn't show that at Lord's as a team and the guys below Sarah and Charlotte were really keen to come out and give a good performance."</p><p>England's quicks fired early, sending Australia's openers back to the pavilion without score. Katherine Brunt claimed the wicket of Rachel Haynes in the third over before Meg Lanning fell to Shrubsole, leaving the visitors reeling at 2-2 after four overs.</p><p>Shrubsole finished with 1-27 off her 10 overs, while Brunt and Colvin each took two wickets.</p><p>"We know these pitches you've got to bowl straight ? that's what me and Katherine have been able to come and do," said Shrubsole. "And to get the wicket of Meg really early, we know she's a key wicket."</p><p>Cameron led a recovery with her captain, Jodie Fields, until the skipper attempted to loft Laura Marsh over mid-on only to see it drop short into the safe hands of Knight for 20.</p><p>Jenny Gunn displayed both bravery and superb reflexes in pulling off the catch of the day, the bowler flattened when Alex Blackwell smashed the ball straight. Gunn finished on her back but somehow managed to nail the catch and leave Australia flailing at 117 for 4 in the 29th over.</p><p>Cameron battled gamely against the tide of a spiralling run rate but when Brunt returned for a second spell the rout was all but complete, the right-arm seamer skittling Cameron's stumps in the 36th over. Holly Colvin cleaned up the tail along with some outstanding work in the field, England forcing three run-outs to complete a convincing all-round performance.</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashes-2013">Ashes 2013</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/england-women-cricket-team">England women's cricket team</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashes">The Ashes</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket">Cricket</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-sport">Australia sport</a></li></ul></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

There was a hollowness in the rhetoric from a man whose fortune was made building a shopping mall, the Gateshead Metrocentre, on a former industrial site and Hall made £75m from selling his shares, ultimately to Mike Ashley, in 2007. So perhaps today's unhappy club, owned by another retail magnate and advertising Wonga payday loans to an economically depressed city, represents the fruition of Hall's vision rather than a&nbsp;shortfall.</p><p>At a downbeat press conference ahead of Saturday's home game against West Ham United at St James' Park, Alan Pardew spoke of Newcastle as financially vulnerable to bigger clubs in the transfer market and said he understood fans' "despondency". This with August sunshine still warming the training pitches outside, and after only one game, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/19/manchester-city-newcastle-premier-league" title="">albeit Monday's 4-0 evisceration by Sheikh Mansour's Manchester City</a>.</p><p>Seasoned fans' despondency goes deeper than a summer of stagnation that, with a week until the transfer window closes, has produced only the striker Loïc Rémy on loan, while Arsenal's bid for Yohan Cabaye, rejected at £10m, risks branding Newcastle as a selling club.</p><p>This is reinforcing the sense that a club that made substantial all-round progress, particularly the season before last when Pardew led a replenished squad to fifth, has suddenly and bewilderingly lurched backwards. Fans' great frustration centres on the owner Ashley's decision to appoint the former Wimbledon manager, Joe Kinnear, as director of football ? a move that Ashley, characteristically, has never explained. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/18/joe-kinnear-newcastle-united-interview" title="">Since Kinnear's early disastrous radio interview</a>, in which among assorted howlers and flights of fancy he named Cabaye "Yohan Kebab", Kinnear has not reassured supporters he is up to so demanding a job, which is elsewhere being greatly professionalised. The best explanation appears to be that Ashley, both at his retail chain Sports Direct and at Newcastle, likes to work with people he knows and trusts and Kinnear is a long-standing acquaintance.</p><p>But Kinnear's apparently precipitated Derek Llambias's resignation as the club's managing director, a position that has not since been filled, with his responsibilities instead split between the finance director, John Irving, and the secretary, Lee Charnley.</p><p>Llambias is also a long-standing friend of Ashley but he confounded the suspicion that another member of a "Cockney mafia" would further muck up the club by proving himself shrewd and formidable. Working with the chief scout, Graham Carr, Llambias negotiated the signings of Demba Ba, Cabaye, Papiss Cissé and Davide Santon in the summer of 2011, and Hatem Ben Arfa and Cheik Tioté the season before, while reaping £35m from selling Andy Carroll to Liverpool and wresting the club's finances, and its image, under control. Last season's 16th-place finish was disappointing and Pardew, Llambias and Carr faced convincing Ashley that they could re-engineer improvement but instead the fans now fear a Cockney mafia-style mess returning.</p><p>Pardew returned a question about Kinnear's role by saying: "We have a procedure in place. Joe is directly the in-line manager for the board and Mike, the owner, so therefore I request to him what I think the team needs and he has to try to get them over the line. We have to make sure we get one or two transfers over the line before deadline."</p><p>That made the position sound rather more structured than many fans fear. "We're wondering, if Joe Kinnear was the answer, what on earth the question was," says Michael Martin, editor of the True Faith fanzine. "This feels so erratic. Newcastle United should represent something, aspire to be a great sporting institution, but it's joyless. The club feels like a bolt-on to Sports Direct and should not have been so desperate for money they put Wonga on our shirts."</p><p>With their £7m-a-year sponsorship, Wonga restored the name St James' Park to the Sports Direct Arena but Ashley's company name is still all over the stadium and training ground. He is tightening his financial hold, reducing the £140m he loaned following his takeover of a club then deep in debt. In 2011-12 Newcastle repaid Ashley £11m and a further £18m was due for repayment by 30 June this year, although the club says none has been repaid and Pardew was adamant Newcastle do not have to sell, Cabaye or anybody else, to sign reinforcements.</p><p>Such care over spending makes a keen contrast with the club's promotion of <a href="http://www.wonga.com/money/is-this-apr-expensive/" title="">Wonga's loans at that infamous APR of 5,853%</a>. Unusually for a northern city, where local authorities tend to resist criticising their Premier League clubs, Nick Forbes, leader of Newcastle city council, is forthright in condemning the Wonga sponsorship.</p><p>He points to the economic facts for Newcastle people in a recession some way from Hall's revivalist talk: joblessness of 10.5%, youth unemployment close to 25%; 30% of Newcastle children in poverty ? and 22,000 people last year seeking advice to cope with debt. "I am horrified by Wonga cynically trying to buy respectability by linking their name with Newcastle United," Forbes says. "I hate the damage this deal is going to do to people's lives, people who can least afford to get into debt. I hate this as an image for Newcastle and feel the club could play a much more positive civic role."</p><p>In the club shop at St James' Park, with its strikingly dominant position in Newcastle, there was an eager, undaunted queue to buy the new shirt, at a 30%-off £44.99 for adults, £34.99 for children. Some boys were taking last year's straight off in the shop, putting this year's on, then walking out, bearing Wonga on their chests. Twenty years since Sir John Hall propounded that vision of revival, Mike Ashley's Newcastle United are treading nervously into their first home match, while parading payday loans to "the <sup></sup>Geordie nation".</p><div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastleunited">Newcastle United</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/mike-ashley">Mike Ashley</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/alan-pardew">Alan Pardew</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/joe-kinnear">Joe Kinnear</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/transfer-window">Transfer window</a></li><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/wonga">Wonga</a></li></ul></div><div class="author"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidconn">David Conn</a></div><br/><div class="terms"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a> &copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
