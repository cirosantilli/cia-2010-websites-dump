NEW YORK (AP) — Bud Selig took over a sport with $1.7 billion in revenue, four teams in each year&#039;s postseason, economic disparity among the clubs and a fixation on sticking with traditions that dated to the 19th century.

(Reuters) - Running back Frank Gore pounded out 153 yards while Colin Kaepernick roared back to form as the visiting San Francisco 49ers spanked St. Louis Rams 35-11 in the National Football League on Thursday. Last season&#039;s Super Bowl losers came into the contest with just one win but evened their ledger at 2-2 as quarterback Kaepernick went 15/23 for 167 yards with two touchdowns. It was a welcome return to form for Kaepernick after he completed just 47.3 percent of his passes and added four interceptions in back-to-back losses coming in.

By Julian Linden NEW YORK (Reuters) - The emotion finally got to Mariano Rivera on Thursday. After playing it super-cool during his 19 years in Major League Baseball, his final game at Yankee Stadium proved too much. Baseball&#039;s greatest closer was reduced to tears, sobbing uncontrollably on the mound as the enormity of the occasion hit him. And he was not alone. His team mates and the Yankees manager Joe Girardi were also overcome with raw emotion, as they embraced him on the field then in the dugout.

Michael Montgomery of Lodi, California, was booked on suspicion of homicide, San Francisco police said. Police gave no information on a second man who was detained earlier on Thursday and it was not immediately clear if he remained in custody.

By Larry Fine NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dignified yet deadly efficient with a game on the line, Mariano Rivera rose from makeshift games on the beach of his hometown fishing village in Panama to become Major League Baseball&#039;s greatest closer. The slender right-hander with the easy motion frustrated hitters for nearly two decades, relying more on precision than power, armed with a confounding, late-breaking version of a fastball that became his signature pitch - the cutter.

By Malathi Nayak SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Electronic Arts said on Thursday that it will not offer gamers the next iteration from its college football video game series &quot;NCAA Football&quot; in 2014 and is evaluating the fate of the game franchise, which is mired in legal disputes with former college athletes. Electronic Arts made the decision because of on-going lawsuits and the withdrawal of support from organizations like the National Collegiate Athletic Association, Cam Weber, the general manager of American football for EA SPORTS, wrote in a blog post.

(Reuters) - Bud Selig, credited with ushering in a new era of growth and change in the game of baseball, will retire as commissioner of Major League Baseball at the end of his current term in January 2015, the league said on Thursday. Selig, 79, took over the rose from Fay Vincent 21 years ago on an interim basis and was unanimously elected MLB&#039;s ninth commissioner in mid-1998. &quot;I am grateful to the owners throughout Major League Baseball for their unwavering support and for allowing me to lead this great institution,&quot; Selig said in a statement.

Raicel Iglesias, 23, is one of the island's top relief pitchers and a member of the Isle of Youth team preparing for the national championship series that starts on November 3. CaféFuerte, a Cuban exile website in Miami, reported that Iglesias left Cuba by boat on Saturday.

The agreement marks Twitter's biggest sports-related commitment to date for its Amplify service. Amplify was formally unveiled last May as a way for Twitter, broadcasters and advertisers to capitalize on peoples' use of social media while they watch TV - a phenomenon called "second screen" viewing.
