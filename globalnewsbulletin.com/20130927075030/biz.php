By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO (Reuters) - Most Asian stock markets posted modest gains up on Friday after U.S. jobless claims data pointed to an improving labor market, but the lack of progress in budget and debt negotiations in Washington kept investors on edge. The solid jobs data revived expectations of a reduction in U.S. monetary stimulus after the Federal Reserve&#039;s surprise decision not to do so last week and conflicting messages from various top Fed officials since then. 
<li><a href='http://news.yahoo.com/fed-needs-better-way-signal-policy-officials-025045844--business.html' target="_self">Fed needs better way to signal policy, officials say</a><br />
By Sakari Suoninen, Alistair Scrutton and Ann Saphir FRANKFURT/STOCKHOLM/HOUGHTON, Michigan (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve confused financial markets over scaling back its bond buying, four top officials said on Thursday, with one arguing the central bank should link tapering to drops in the jobless rate and another calling for a broad remake of strategy. Fed Board Governor Jeremy Stein said he would have been comfortable with acting at the September 17-18 meeting, and the decision to keep buying bonds at an $85 billion monthly pace had been, for him, a &quot;close call&quot;.

By Olivia Oran and Alexei Oreskovic NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alibaba Group Holding Ltd founder Jack Ma wants to keep a tight grip on the Chinese e-commerce company he founded even after he takes it public, and U.S. law gives him several ways to do so. The company had planned to list in Hong Kong, but the exchange there threw cold water on Ma&#039;s plan to give Alibaba&#039;s insiders, who only own about 10 percent of the stock, the power to nominate a majority of the board, sources say. Regulators in the Chinese territory said that all shareholders must be treated equally.

By John O&#039;Donnell and Eva Taylor BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank&#039;s (ECB) plan to test the health of the euro zone&#039;s largest lenders without the means to plug any holes it uncovers risks foiling what some see as the bloc&#039;s final chance to put its financial crisis behind it. Unlike in the United States, where rapid infusions of capital put its banks quickly back on track, Europe&#039;s financial system remains frozen, with lenders in countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy hurt by weak demand and soured loans.

(Reuters) - Alibaba Group&#039;s biggest shareholders have backed a partnership structure that is at the center of a debate over where the Chinese e-commerce giant may list its shares in the most highly anticipated Internet IPO since Facebook Inc&#039;s $16 billion offer last year. Alibaba, which analysts value at as much as $120 billion, appears to have failed to convince Hong Kong regulators to waive tough listing rules, potentially handing the lucrative IPO to rival U.S. market operators.

By Huw Jones and John O&#039;Donnell LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain&#039;s challenge to European Union rules capping bankers&#039; bonuses is likely to get bogged down in court long beyond their implementation, and critics say it is more about pleasing domestic voters unimpressed by the loss of powers to Brussels. The UK, which houses Europe&#039;s biggest financial center, was outvoted when the European Union agreed that bonuses must be no more than a banker&#039;s fixed pay, or twice that amount with shareholder backing.

By Peter Murphy BOGOTA (Reuters) - U.S. commodities trader Cargill bought a large area of farming land in Colombia many times bigger than the legal limit by setting up dozens of &quot;shell companies&quot;, violating the spirit of agrarian reform laws, charity Oxfam said in a report Friday. In the research report &quot;Divide and Purchase,&quot; Oxfam says Cargill set up the companies to buy land up to the legal limit for any individual or company, to farm all of the adjoining land as a single plantation and get around restrictions designed to promote distribution of land to smallholder farmers.

(Reuters) - Piraeus Bank SA , Greece&#039;s second-largest bank, is planning to list unit Geniki Bank on the stock exchange in the next six months, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing people briefed on the plan. Piraeus has hired Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays PLC to advise on the listing, which could raise about 200 million euros ($270 million) to 300 million euros, the newspaper reported. (http://link.reuters.com/ras43v) Piraeus will try to retain 10 percent to 20 percent of Geniki for the time being, the FT said.

By Julien Toyer MADRID (Reuters) - Spain will boost economic and job forecasts in the 2014 budget to be presented on Friday, moving away from tough spending cuts and relying instead on lower borrowing costs and momentum from previous reforms to achieve fiscal targets. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, almost half-way into his four-year mandate, is hoping that after two years of painful spending cuts the relatively benign budget will persuade disgruntled Spaniards that the worst of the crisis is behind them.

By Lin Noueihed LONDON (Reuters) - Some foreign workers at an Algerian desert gas plant feared for their safety well before Islamist militants killed dozens at the site, and relatives and survivors want joint operator BP to investigate its own security record. Forty oil workers, all but one foreign, died at In Amenas in January after the militants took expatriates hostage during a four-day siege that ended when Algerian forces stormed the site.
