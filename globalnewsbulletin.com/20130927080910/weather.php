STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Top climate scientists blamed mankind more clearly than ever as the main cause of global warming in a report on Friday meant to guide governments in dealing with rising temperatures, delegates said. "It's been accepted," Jonathan Lynn, spokesman for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, told reporters. Delegates said the report raised the probability that most global warming was manmade to 95 percent, from 90 percent in its previous report in 2007. The report also says that a recent slowdown in warming is unlikely to last.

Drafts show that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is set to pronounce that most of the warming of the Earth&#039;s surface since the 1950s is &quot;extremely likely&quot; -- at least 95 percent probable -- to be man-made. At its last meeting in 2007, it put the probability at 90 percent, and in 2001 it was 66 percent. </p><br clear="all"/>
