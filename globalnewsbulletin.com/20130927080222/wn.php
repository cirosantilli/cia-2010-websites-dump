Iran and world powers including the US have agreed to substantive nuclear talks in Geneva next month. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Thursday&#39;s talks between Iran, Germany and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council were &quot;substantial&quot; and have set the stage

By Environment Correspondent Alister Doyle STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A U.N. panel of global climate scientists were set to work through Thursday night to ensure that their strongest case yet for man-made global warming would make sense to the widest possible audience. Drafts show that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is set to pronounce that most of the warming of the Earth's surface since the 1950s is "extremely likely" -- at least 95 percent probable -- to be man-made. At its last meeting in 2007, it put the probability at 90 percent, and in 2001 it was 66 percent. The

Reuters September 26, 2013 - 21:04 By Matt Spetalnick UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Thursday that "time is running out" for Middle East peace efforts and urged world powers to rein in Israeli settlement construction that he said could undermine U.S.-sponsored negotiations. In an address to an annual gathering of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, Abbas committed to negotiating with Israel in good faith but he also painted what he called a "dispiriting and bleak" picture for peace prospects. Abbas's assessment came one day after Secretary of State John Kerry suggested a more hopeful outlook, saying the two sides had agreed to intensify

MARIETTA, Ga. — Former San Diego Chargers and University of Georgia defensive back Paul Oliver committed suicide at his Atlanta-area home, a medical examiner said Wednesday. The 29-year-old Oliver was found dead Tuesday night in Marietta, about 20 miles northwest of Atlanta, Cobb County Medical Examiner&#8217;s investigator Tim Weaver said. Oliver died of a

European political leadership is desperately in need of new energy and vision. Within Europe's ongoing deep malaise an unexpected element has appeared: the new pontiff, Pope Francis. The thoughts that follow are inspired by the surprising popular enthusiasm his initial public appearances seem to generate as well as the much-commented interview published in the September 30 issue of America: the National Catholic Review. This is admittedly not much to go on but Europe's well-wishers have to work with what we have, hoping that we're not just grasping at straws. It's not implausible to think that a contemporary pope might have a significant effect on European affairs writ large, beyond

BRUSSELS Belgium 26 September, 2013 (Reuters) - The European Union has increased security precautions for its military advisers in Somalia after the deadly attack by Somali Islamists on a Kenyan shopping mall, it said on Thursday. The EU has 120 military experts, split between the Somali capital Mogadishu and Uganda, training and advising Somali security

MURMANSK, Russia (AP) — A Russian court on Thursday jailed the U.S. captain of a Greenpeace ship along with a photographer and several activists who were part of a 30-member team protesting near an oil platform in the Arctic last week. The Russian Coast Guard disrupted an attempt by the activists on Sept. 18 to scale the Russian Arctic platform. Russian authorities seized Greenpeace's ship, the Arctic

(Source: Amnesty International) Amnesty International's Secretary General Salil Shetty called on governments to act on their promises to end the flow of conventional arms that fuel atrocities and abuse, after the number of countries that signed the historic Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) passed the 100 mark. At the United Nations in New York on Wednesday, Shetty told a meeting of government ministers and senior officials - including UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon - how Amnesty International began the long journey for the treaty in 1993. He said

Reuters DUBAI — Reformist former president Mohammad Khatami called for all political prisoners in Iran to be freed following a decision to pardon 80 people in an easing of the Islamic Republic&#39;s strict security policies. The pardons were in keeping with moderate President Hassan Rouhani&#39;s pledge to loosen a repressive security grip that Iranians say has been prevalent since the 2009 re-election of his hardline conservative predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In comments published on his

UNITED NATIONS: UN leader Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday pressed the major powers to overcome differences on the Syria war amid difficult talks on a UN Security Council resolution on Syria’s chemical arms. Countries suffering the refugee fallout from the 30-month-old conflict separately made pleas for help to cope with growing numbers of fleeing Syrians. Ban hosted a lunch with the foreign ministers of the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France — the permanent Security Council members — to put across his message, UN officials said. The meeting discussed a Russia-US plan to destroy President Bashar al-Assad’s chemical

DENVER - Six people who were unaccounted for after massive flooding in Colorado have been found safe and well, authorities said Tuesday. Only one person remained missing and presumed dead. Eight deaths have been confirmed. It was a remarkable outcome after a disaster that damaged or destroyed nearly 2,000 homes, washed out hundreds of miles of roads and left many small mountain towns completely cut off. In the early days of the flooding, more than 1,200 people were listed as

Print 24 September 2013 &#150 In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly&#8217;s high-level debate today, the President of Mozambique, Armando Em&#237;lio Guebuza, called for international support to some of the hotspots in Africa, noting that development can only occur in a climate of peace and security. In his statement, President Guebuza told world leaders who gathered for the debate, which started today, that &#8220;in seeking solutions for the conflicts in different parts of the world, the multilateral approach based on the principles of the UN Charter must prevail.&#8221; Mr. Guebuza urged international support for Madagascar, which established the dates for the
