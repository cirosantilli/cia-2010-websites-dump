Apple may never have had any intention of selling a budget smartphone but its iPhone 5c is already on its way to becoming one in China. Caijing reports that China’s largest business-to-consumer retail platform has slashed the price of the 5c from 4488 yuan (or around USD $733) to 3699 yuan (USD $604). Caijing says that the discount comes amid weak early sales for the 5c, which has been eclipsed in the high-end Chinese market by the iPhone 5s. The general consensus among analysts so far has been that Apple’s iPhone 5c was not priced aggressively enough to appeal to most consumers in emerging markets. If the device keeps getting the discount treatment from other outlets this early after its release then

With that in mind, Twitter is giving greater emphasis to photos within tweets by placing them front and center in the post, with the actual tweet serving as a simple caption below. Looking at it now, the decision seems an obvious one, but all photos were previously smaller and subservient to the short text.</p><br clear="all"/>

Dolphin, a third-party mobile browser that runs on Android and iOS, is apparently tired of seeing Google reign as the de-factor king of the Internet. Because of this, it’s formed what it calls an “anti-Google alliance” with international search engines to add some more diversity to the global mobile search realm. The alliance includes Russian search engine Yandex, Chinese engine Baidu, Yahoo Japan and DuckDuckGo, the privacy-friendly American search engine that has become a favorite for anti-NSA activists.  Dolphin says that it’s partnering with these companies because its mobile browser is “designed to better serve users in ‘mobile-first’ countries, who do all of their browsing from a mobile phone, by bringing content directly to users, acting as an entertainment hub

Netflix has been the movie and TV streaming service to beat for years, but the company continues to explore potential avenues for expansion. Bloomberg reports that Netflix has been offering to partner with cable companies for two years, but has yet to make much headway. Two European cable companies, Virgin Media in the U.K. and Com Hem AB in Sweden, have both decided to include Netflix as an app on TiVo set-top boxes, but U.S. companies have yet to accept the partnership. “We would love to reduce the friction to the end consumer, and to be available via the existing device in the home, which is the set-top box,” Netflix CFO David Wells said.

To celebrate its birthday, the company invited a small number of reporters to the Menlo Park garage where it got its start, and it rolled out a handful of new search features. But, as cool as all that is, what&#039;s arguably more fun is a simple easter egg worked into Google.com. If you type &quot;Google in 1998&quot; into the search field on Google.com, the website will transform into the design it had 15 years ago when the company first launched. If you&#039;re horrified by the retro look — and its Yahoo-esque exclamation point — don&#039;t worry. </p><br clear="all"/>

If it seems like everyone you know with an iPhone has already updated to iOS 7, that’s because almost everyone has. Mixpanel began tracking the iOS 7 adoption rate after the software update went live last week, and reported that the update quickly made its way into 29% of iPhones. Over the weekend, iOS 7 had been downloaded by more than 50% of iPhone owners, and on Thursday the adoption rate had reached 60%. Fiksu’s tracking service reports similar numbers, currently sitting at just under a 59% adoption rate. Fiksu has also charted iOS 7 usage relative to previous iOS updates, and the trend shows that iOS 7 is still way ahead of the curve. Check out Mixpanel‘s chart below.
