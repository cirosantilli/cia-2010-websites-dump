By Steve Gutterman MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court ordered 20 Greenpeace activists from around the world to be held in custody for two months pending further investigation over a protest against offshore oil drilling in the Arctic, drawing condemnation and a vow to appeal. In proceedings that Greenpeace said evoked Soviet-era scare tactics, activists from a ship used in the protest at an oil rig were led to court in the port of Murmansk in handcuffs and held in cages for a series of hearings that ended early on Friday.

By Lesley Wroughton UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Zimbabwe&#039;s President Robert Mugabe on Thursday berated the United States and former colonial power Britain and its allies for trying to control his nation and its resources, telling them to remove their &quot;illegal and filthy sanctions.&quot; &quot;Shame, shame, shame to the United States of America. Shame, shame, shame to Britain and its allies,&quot; Mugabe, 89, said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly. &quot;Zimbabwe is for Zimbabweans, so are its resources.

SFAX, Tunisia (Reuters) - Thousands protested in cities across Tunisia on Thursday to call on the ruling Islamist Ennahda party to step down immediately to make way for new elections to end a stalemate with its secular opponents. The North African nation that started the 2011 &quot;Arab Spring&quot; revolts has been caught in political deadlock since July after the assassination of an opposition leader. Waving national flags and chanting &quot;Leave Now&quot;, protesters took to the streets of six cities to demand the resignation a government critics fear wants impose a hardline Islamist agenda.

By John Irish UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Mali&#039;s newly elected President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita called on Thursday for nations in the Sahara region to create a regional multilateral force that could intervene quickly to respond to the ongoing Islamist threat across the area. Attacks in Niger, growing instability in southern Libya and clashes between Tunisian government troops and Islamist militants have shown how al-Qaeda-linked rebels have taken advantage of a security vacuum in the region since French-led forces intervened in Mali earlier this year to oust them.

By Ivana Sekularac PODGORICA (Reuters) - There was once a time when a job at Podgorica&#039;s sprawling aluminum plant meant a free apartment, a discount on holiday rentals and a large dose of prestige in socialist Yugoslavia. In its heyday in the late 1970s, Kombinat Aluminijuma Podgorica (KAP) supported the families of 5,000 workers. Now, with its workforce cut to a fifth, huge parts of the complex resemble a ghost town, blanketed in dust and suffocated by debts of more than 380 million euros ($513 million).

By Daniel Bases, Stephen Adler and Dina Kyriakidou NEW YORK (Reuters) - Greece does not require a third bailout and can cover its needs without further burdening its current backers, by improving the terms of its debt and possibly returning to the bond market next year, the country&#039;s deputy prime minister said on Wednesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - The newly appointed chairman of Britain's proposed high speed rail network said on Thursday his first task would be to seek cross-party support for the 42.6 billion pound ($68.5 billion) project. David Higgins, chief executive of Network Rail who headed the Olympic Delivery Authority, will take up the role in January, replacing Doug Oakervee.

By Michelle Nichols UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Europe&#039;s aid chief on Wednesday urged the U.N. Security Council to adopt a resolution to boost humanitarian access in Syria, an issue that has simmered for months in the shadow of plans for peace talks and a deal on destroying Syrian chemical weapons. While 2 million Syrians have fled the civil war, there are more than 4 million people displaced inside the country and in urgent need of help, but violence and bureaucratic red-tape has slowed aid to a trickle, the United Nations has said.

By John Irish and Louis Charbonneau UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Envoys from the United States, Russia, France, China and Britain have come to an agreement on the core of a U.N. Security Council resolution to get rid of Syria&#039;s chemical weapons, three Western diplomats said on Wednesday, but Russia denied such an accord had been reached and insisted work was &quot;still going on.

Chancellor Angela Merkel led her conservatives to their best result in decades in a German election on September 22, but must still find a coalition partner to secure a third term. She is expected to turn first to the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), with whom she ruled between 2005 and 2009, but could also talk with the environmentalist Greens. Below are key coalition-related quotes from senior officials since the election, as well as areas of potential compromise on policy and personnel.

By Erika Solomon BEIRUT (Reuters) - Thousands of Syrian rebels have broken with the Western-backed coalition and called for a new Islamist front, undermining international efforts to build up a pro-Western military force to replace President Bashar al-Assad. Ever more divided on a battlefield where Assad's better armed troops have been gaining ground, allies of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) were among 13 disparate rebel factions to disown the exile leadership and build an Islamic alliance that includes the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, commanders said on Tuesday.

By Jan Lopatka PRAGUE (Reuters) - Slovak-born billionaire Andrej Babis has built up the biggest Czech food, agriculture and chemicals group but got so upset with politicians in the process that he now aims to enter parliament himself in next month&#039;s election. His ANO (YES) movement has shot up the opinion polls, and the tycoon, a Communist Party member in totalitarian Czechoslovakia who then made it onto the Forbes rich list, stands a strong chance of becoming a political force.

By Georgina Prodhan VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria&#039;s far-right Freedom Party (FPO) appears likely to raise its share of the vote in Sunday elections, drawing on fears over bailouts for needier euro zone countries and the cost of supporting asylum seekers. Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann&#039;s government coalition may well survive, but opinion poll trends suggest the FPO could overtake his conservative junior partner, the People&#039;s Party. Austria&#039;s overall prosperity at a time of hardship in Europe has done little to dampen historic unease at immigration. &quot;Love thy neighbor.

By Abdi Sheikh and Richard Lough MOGADISHU/NAIROBI (Reuters) - Somali Islamist militant group al Shabaab&#039;s attack on a shopping mall in the heart of the Kenyan capital has thrust it to the forefront of the global jihadist movement after years of internal feuding over the group&#039;s aims. The apparent sophistication of the weekend raid, involving 15 or so heavily-armed fighters who held off Kenya&#039;s military for four days, suggests careful planning and a trained strike force that goes beyond the group&#039;s hallmark hit-and-run tactics.
