By Silke Koltrowitz ZURICH (Reuters) - Don't expect your $10,000 wristwatch to be surfing the Web or calling your broker any time soon. High-end Swiss watchmakers seem agreed that their concept of timeless luxury does not sit well with the "gadget" appeal of smartwatches. "A smartwatch is programmed to become obsolete," Jean-Claude Biver, chairman of luxury watchmaker Hublot, told Reuters. "How could I mix Hublot with something made for obsolescence? It's impossible," said Biver, who added he had rebuffed a big technology group which wanted to explore future projects.

The current account deficit in the April-June quarter widened to $1.70 billion, an increase of $160 million from the same quarter of 2012, according to a balance of payments statement posted on the bank&#039;s website. </p><br clear="all"/>

By Ranga Sirilal COLOMBO (Reuters) - The Maldives' Supreme Court on Monday postponed a presidential election run-off scheduled for September 28 to allow it to consider a challenge from a defeated first-round candidate, denting hopes of an end to months of political turmoil. The candidate, Gasim Ibrahim, a tourism and media tycoon who was finance minister under long-time ruler Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, came third with 24.07 percent of votes in the first round on September 7, just behind Gayoom's half-brother Abdulla Yameen, on 25.35 percent.
