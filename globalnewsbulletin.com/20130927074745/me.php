UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.S. and its international partners emerged from a meeting with Iran declaring that a &quot;window of opportunity has opened&quot; to peacefully settle their nuclear standoff. But diplomats asked Tehran to come back with a detailed plan of action to reassure the world it is not trying to build an atomic bomb.

By Matt Spetalnick UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Thursday that &quot;time is running out&quot; for Middle East peace efforts and urged world powers to rein in Israeli settlement construction that he warned could undermine U.S.-sponsored negotiations. In an address to an annual gathering of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, Abbas committed to negotiating with Israel in good faith but he also painted what he called a &quot;dispiriting and bleak&quot; picture for peace prospects.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — U.S. and European diplomats welcomed a &quot;significant shift&quot; in Iran&#039;s attitude at talks on Thursday aimed at resolving the impasse over Tehran&#039;s disputed nuclear activities. Iran said it was eager to dispel the notion that it is trying to develop a nuclear weapon and to get international sanctions lifted as fast as possible.

New York City (AFP) - Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas warned the United Nations on Thursday that US-brokered peace talks offered the “last chance” as he demanded an agreement with Israel that permanently resolves all disputes.

Johannesburg (AFP) - Somalia&#039;s Shebab militia, which carried out a bloody attack on Nairobi&#039;s Westgate mall, is in part funded by the poaching trade, wildlife activists said Thursday.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepal recalled its ambassador in Qatar on Thursday after she called the Gulf state an "open jail" for Nepalis who suffer labor abuses, and amid outrage about labor conditions and deaths as the emirate prepares to host the 2022 World Cup. Maya Kumari Sharma's remarks were made about six months ago in an interview but only attracted attention this week after they were reprinted in a report by Britain's Guardian newspaper that documented the deaths of dozens of Nepali workers in Qatar over the summer.

Beirut (AFP) - Jihadist fighters linked to Al-Qaeda set fire to statues and crosses inside churches in northern Syria on Thursday and destroyed a cross on a church clock tower, a watchdog said.

By Fredrik Dahl VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has sharply criticized the U.N. nuclear watchdog over &quot;baseless allegations&quot; about its atomic activity, a document showed before talks between the two sides on Friday to discuss a stalled inquiry into suspected bomb research by Tehran. The uncompromising language in the paper, and the fact that Iran asked the U.N. agency to make it public, may disappoint those hoping for a softening of the Islamic state&#039;s nuclear stance under new President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate.

As far as snubs go, Egypt’s precipitous return of $2 billion in aid from Qatar earlier this week couldn’t have been any clearer. Then Egypt’s civil aviation ministry turned down a Qatar Airways request to increase the number of flights between the two countries. For weeks Egyptian authorities had been hounding Qatar’s flagship satellite news network Al Jazeera, storming its local offices, deporting its correspondents and forcing the station off the air. Qatar, Egypt’s new leadership seems to be saying, is no longer a friend.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Heading into a historic meeting on Tehran&#039;s disputed nuclear activities, Iran&#039;s new president called on Israel on Thursday to join an international treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons, chiding the Jewish state for being the only Mideast nation that has failed to do so.

By Louis Charbonneau and Yeganeh Torbati UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Iran&#039;s foreign minister expressed hope on Wednesday that a meeting with top diplomats from the United States and five other powers this week will jump-start negotiations to resolve the decade-long dispute over the Iranian nuclear program. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif is set to meet with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry as well as diplomats from Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany on Thursday in New York in a rare encounter between American and Iranian officials.

JERUSALEM (AP) — With a few words in a largely conciliatory speech to the United Nations, Iran&#039;s new president took aim at an Israeli fear: that international pressure on the Iranian nuclear program could lead to scrutiny of Israel&#039;s own secretive nuclear facilities.
<li><a href='http://news.yahoo.com/israel-challenged-iran-charm-offensive-200114637.html' target="_self">Israel challenged by Iran charm offensive</a><br />
Jerusalem (AFP) - As Iran&#039;s new president reaches out to the West with a message of moderation, Israel&#039;s hawkish approach on Tehran&#039;s nuclear programme looks likely to come under pressure, experts say.

By Jeffrey Heller and Dan Williams JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A charm offensive toward the West by Iran&#039;s new president and his nuanced approach to his predecessor&#039;s Holocaust denial have run into an Israeli wall of suspicion hardened by Tehran&#039;s nuclear pursuits. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will not be fooled by Hassan Rouhani&#039;s international outreach, and the world must not be either.

By Jeff Mason and Yeganeh Torbati UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Tuesday cautiously embraced overtures from Iran&#039;s new president as the basis for a possible nuclear deal, but a failed effort to arrange a simple handshake between the two leaders underscored entrenched distrust that will be hard to overcome. In a speech to the United Nations, Obama said he was determined to test President Hassan Rouhani&#039;s recent diplomatic gestures and challenged him to take concrete steps toward resolving Iran&#039;s long-running nuclear dispute with the West.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Iran&#039;s new president told world leaders Tuesday that the biggest danger in the Middle East is chemical weapons falling into the hands of &quot;extremist terrorist groups&quot; in Syria and he blamed the countries backing the opposition for fueling the civil war there.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Lebanon&#039;s president said Tuesday that his country was struggling under the weight of at least a million Syrian refugees as the U.S. pledged tens of millions of dollars in aid to offset the costs of the war spillover.

Iran’s new President Hassan Rouhani made his long-awaited debut on the world stage when he delivered his address late Tuesday afternoon before the U.N. General Assembly. Rouhani’s demagogic predecessor, former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, had cemented his global reputation on the floor of the U.N.’s largest chamber through tirades that, like clockwork, triggered walkouts by Western and Israeli delegations. While the Israelis were predictable no-shows this time, the U.S. was represented by its deputy ambassador to the U.N. — a marked improvement in attendance from previous years.

By Dan Williams JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel said on Tuesday the world should not be fooled by Iran&#039;s conciliatory overtures over its disputed nuclear program after U.S. President Barack Obama told the United Nations that Washington was ready to engage Tehran diplomatically. An official Israeli assessment said Iran now had centrifuges for quickly turning low-enriched uranium into nuclear bomb fuel, putting it on a fast track to nuclear arms even if it gave up uranium of mid-level purity - previously Israel&#039;s goal.

By Paul Eckert, Louis Charbonneau and Arshad Mohammed UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in a move that puts the Obama administration at odds with the powerful American gun lobby, will sign the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty regulating the $70 billion international conventional arms business, diplomats said on Tuesday. A senior State Department official said President Barack Obama&#039;s administration would notify the U.S. Senate on Tuesday and Kerry would sign the treaty on Wednesday on the sidelines of the annual U.N.

By Erika Solomon and Stephen Kalin BEIRUT (Reuters) - Hunger is a growing threat to Syrians living in regions hit by the civil war and children are now dying of malnutrition, according to aid groups and activists. Cases of malnutrition in Syria are still rare but they were unheard before the revolt against President Bashar al-Assad broke out in March 2011. Syrian activists have filmed the bodies of several skeletal children who doctors said died of malnutrition. The most recent victim was one-year-old Rana Obeid, who died on Tuesday.
