By Kim Dixon and Patrick Temple-West WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the sweeping new U.S. healthcare law takes hold, the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department are working on a long list of jobs to help implement "Obamacare." The IRS is playing a major part in rolling out President Barack Obama's new insurance system, meant to help millions of uninsured Americans obtain adequate healthcare coverage. While congressional Republicans fought to dismantle the law, the Obama administration said on Thursday government insurance exchanges for individuals will open on October 1 as scheduled.

The old factory, which for decades churned out Hershey chocolate bars, has been conditionally sold to a start-up called Tweed Inc, which plans to use about a third of the 470,000 square foot plant to grow medical marijuana. "It's an exciting opportunity," said Mark Zekulin, Tweed's vice president of community engagement.

(Reuters) - Nektar Therapeutics said its experimental drug to treat chronic pain in patients with arthritis of the knee failed to meet its main goal in a mid-stage clinical trial.

This lack of a placebo rebound was "unusual," the company said. Half the 213 patients in the study were dosed with Nektar's NKTR-181 drug, while the other half was given a placebo.

By Kathryn Doyle NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - For people with a painful cartilage condition, common pain relievers may have small benefits for depression symptoms as well, a new study hints. Depression is more than twice as common among people with osteoarthritis, which happens when cartilage wears down around the hands, lower back, knees or other joints. As many as 27 million Americans have osteoarthritis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To help manage their pain, those patients often take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, like ibuprofen or naproxen.

By C. E. Huggins NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Rates of overweight and obesity in U.S. children and teens may be leveling off, but kids at the extreme - the severely obese - are still swelling in numbers and need attention, according to a new statement from the American Heart Association (AHA). Between 4 percent and 6 percent of youth in the United States are severely obese, with serious accompanying health problems, the researchers say. "Four to six percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S.

By Sophie Knight TOKYO (Reuters) - The pharmaceutical head at Swiss firm Novartis AG apologized to the Japanese public for alleged manipulation of data in trials of its best-selling blood pressure drug Diovan, saying an employee had acted inappropriately. Divisional head David Epstein made the comments after meeting with Japanese health minister Norihisa Tamura in Tokyo. He agreed to cooperate with the ministry to resolve the issue. "We express our deep regret for the concern that the issue has brought to patients, to the medical society as well as the ministry," Epstein said.

By Genevra Pittman NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Mobile dermatology applications may help people learn about UV rays or keep tabs on their moles, but they are not a substitute for seeing a doctor, researchers said Wednesday. They searched online stores and found over 200 dermatology apps, half of them made for non-doctors. Those included sunscreen recommendation guides, mole photo storage apps and tools meant to help diagnose melanoma.
